<Pre>

                NOTE YEE STUPID UBUNTU USERS:

In case you don't have <ext2fs/ext2_fs.h>, (MOST STUPID UbuntuS do NOT!!)
                                          but almost ALL other Linux have!!
                                              So, you be the judge!!!
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.       sudo apt-get install e2fslibs-dev
   to install <ext2fs> (to your /usr/include/ directory)

2. Go to that directory, open ext2_fs.h file to see the 
         SUPER, INOODE, DIR structures.

3. OR download ~samples/LAB4/ext2type.h and use it instead.

                DUE: Sumbission March 25,2015

/***************  DUE & DEMO : Week of March 25,2015 ********************
 Write a C program, showblock, which displays the disk blocks of a file 
 in an EXT2 file system. The program runs as follows

       showblock   DEVICE    PATHNAME

e.g.   showblock   mydisk    /a/b/c/d

 It locates the file named PATHNAME and prints the disk blocks (direct, 
 indirect, double-indirect) of the file.
***********************************************************************/ 

               HOW TO Traverse EXT2 File System Tree

1. Traverse the EXT2 FS tree
   Given a device, e.g. mydisk (a virtual FD image), containing an ext2 file
   system, and a pathname, e.g. /cs360/is/fun of a file, find the file.

   NOTE!!! To find a file amounts to finding its INODE. 
           From the inode, you have ALL the information of a file.
  
2. ALGORITHM
  
(0). Read a disk block into a buffer: Write a get_block() function

     #define BLKSIZE 1024

     get_block(int fd, int blk, char buf[BLKSIZE])
     {
         lseek(fd, (long)(blk*BLKSIZE), 0);
         read(fd, buf, BLKSIZE);
     }


(1). Open the device for READ: int fd = open(device, O_RDONLY);
 
   Read in Superblock (blk #1) to verify it's indeed an ext2 FS. (HOW?)

   (With the SuperBlock read in, you might as well print some of its important
    fields, e.g. nblocks, ninodes, ngroups, inodes_per_group, number of free 
    inodes and blocks, etc.
   )

(2). Read in the group descriptor block (block #2 for FD) and access Group0 
   Descriptor. From its bg_inode_table entry, determine where INODEs begin on 
   the disk. Call it the InodesBeginBlock.  

(3). Read in InodeBeginBlock to get the inode of /, which is INODE #2.
     NOTE: inode number counts from 1. Technique:

         char buf[1024]; 
         get_block(fd, inodeBeginBlock, buf)
         INODE *ip = (INODE *)buf + 1;

(4). Break up pathname into components and let the number of components be n,
     Example:
                            |<----- n = 3  ---->|
         /cs360/is/fun  ==> cs360     is      fun 

   Denote the token strings by name[0], name[1], ..., name[n-1]

   YOU HAVE DONE THESE MANY TIMES BEFORE!!!

(5). Start from the root INODE in (3), search for name[0] in its data block(s).
   For DIR inodes, you may assume that (the number of entries is small so that)
   it only has 12 DIRECT data blocks. Therefore, search only the direct blocks 
   for name[0].

   Each data block of a DIR inode contains DIR structures of the form 

   BLOCK0: [ino 12 1 .   ] [ino 12 2 ..  ] [ino rlen nlen NAME ] ....
  
   BLOCK1: [ino rlen nlen NAME] [ino rlen nlen NAME] [ino rlen nlen NAME ] ....
   etc.
   
   where each NAME is a seqeunce of nlen chars (without terminating NULL !!!) 
   You may use nlen to extract the NAME string, and rlen to advance to the 
   next DIR structure. The technique is

        char buf[1024];
        DIR  *dp = (DIR *dp)buf    // access buf[] as DIR entries
        char *cp = buf;            // char pointer pointing at buf[ ]

        read a block into buf[ ];
        while(cp < buf + BLKSIZE){
           if (name[0] matches dp->NAME)
              return dp->ino;
           cp += dp->rlen;         // advance cp by rlen in bytes
           dp = (SHUT_UP)cp;       // pull dp to the next DIR entry
        }

   If name[0] exists. you can find its inode number.

(6). Use the inode number, ino, to locate the corresponding INODE:
     Recall that ino counts from 1.  Use the Mailman's algorithm

               (ino - 1) / 8    and   InodeBeginBlock    
               (ino - 1) % 8 
               
     to read in the INODE of /cs360

   NOTE: the number 8 comes from: for FD, blockSize=1024 and inodeSize=128. 
         If BlockSize != 1024, you must adjust the number 8 accordingly.

   From the INODE of /cs360, you can easily determine whether it's a DIR.
   (Remember S_ISDIR(), S_ISREG() ?)
  
   If it's not a DIR, there can't be anything like /cs360/is ...., so give up.

   If it's a DIR and there are more components yet to search (BAD NEWS!)
   you must go on.

   The problem now becomes:
       Search for name[1] in the INODE of /cs360
   which is exactly the same as that of Step (5).

(7). Since Steps (5)-(6) will be repeated n times, you should write a function
 
     int search(INODE *inodePtr, char *name)
         {
           // search for name in the data blocks of this INODE
           // if found, return name's ino;
           // return 0
         }


(8). Then, all you have to do is call search() n times, as sketched below.

     Assume:  n,  name[0], ...., name[n-1]   are globals

     ip --> INODE of /

     for (i= 0; i < n; i++){
         inumber = search(ip, name[i])  
         if (inumber == 0) : can't find name[i], BOMB OUT!
         -------------------------------------------------------
         use inumber to read in its INODE and let ip --> this INODE 
     }
  
     // if you reach here, you must have ip --> the INODE of pathname.


(9). Extract information from ip --> as required.
     Pat yourself on the back and say: Good Job!

**************************************************************************
             Self Challenge and EXTRA CREDITS (50%):

   Make your showblock work (CORRECTLY!) for EXT2/3 FS on hard disks.

NOTE: In order to adpat your showblock.c program for HDs, you must do some 
RESEARCH about ext2/3 FS on large HD partitions. You can get the full extra 
credit only if you can

====================================================
1. login to YOUR account on cs360.eecs.wsu.edu
2  Run you showblock program as
       sudo a.out /dev/sda1 /home/YOURACCOUNT/LAB5/a.out
   AND it generates the right outputs.
====================================================

10. SAMPLES SOLUTION in samples/LAB6/:
            showblock.bin, fdimage 
    Run it under Linux as
            showblock.bin DEVICE pathname 

    e.g.    showblock fdimage /Z/hugefile
