         360 Notes on Process Management in Unix/Linux

1. Read Linux man pages on
        fork, exec, wait, exit

2. Process:
   A process is the execution of an image. It is a sequence of executions 
   regarded as a single entity by the Unix kernel. Each process has a unique pid
   and a ppid, which identify the process and its parent process. Processes in 
   Unix form a family tree. They compete for CPU time to run. 

3. Process Origin:
   How does a process begin? When Unix/Linux starts, it creates a process P0 by
   brutle force. P0 creates a child process P1, which is the INIT process. P1 
   forks many children processes, one on each terminal as the LOGIN process on 
   that terminal. Each LOGIN process opens 3 stream FILEs,stdin, stdout, stderr,
   and waits for a user to login. After a user login,the LOGIN process becomes 
   the user process. Typically, the user process execute sh, so it's known as 
   the sh process. When sh sees an a.out command, it forks a child process to 
   execute a.out. The sh process "waits" until the child process dies. Then it 
   prompts for another command.  

4. Process Image:
   In Unix, a process executes in two different modes; Kernel mode or User 
   mode, denoted by Kmode or Umode, for short. In each mode, a process has
   an "execution image", as shown by the following figure.

                  Images of Process i:
       ------------------------------------------ 
       Kmode :    Kcode_i  Kdata_i   Kstack_i
       ==========================================
       Umode :    Ucode_i  Udata_i   Ustack_i
       ------------------------------------------
   The index i indicates these are the images of process i. In general, the 
   Umode images of processes are all different. However, while in Kmode they 
   share the same Kcode and Kdata, which are those of the Unix Kernel, but each
   process has its own Kstack.
    
   A process migrates between Kmode and Umode many many times during its life
   time.

   Every process comes into existence and begins execution in Kmode. In fact,
   it does everything of interest, including to die (or terminate), in Kmode. 
   While in Kmode, it can come to Umode easily (by changing CPU's status from 
   K to U mode) Once in Umode it cannot change CPU's status arbitrarily. A Umode
   process can enter Kmode in only one of 3 ways:

   (1). Interrupts : Interrupts are hardware signals to the CPU. When an
                     interrupt occurs, CPU will enter Kmode to handle the 
                     interrupt, which causes the process to enter Kmode. 
   (2). Traps: Traps are error conditions, such as invalid address, illegal 
               instruction, divide by 0, etc. recognized by the CPU, causing it
               to enter Kmode to deal with the error. Since traps are caused by
               the executing process on the CPU, the process typically dies
               (with a dreadful message such as "Segmentation Fault").

   (3). System Calls:
        System call (or syscall for short) is a mechanism that allows a process
        to enter Kmode to execute Kernel functions. When the Kernel function 
        finishes, it comes back to Umode with a return value, which is normally
        0 for success or -1 for error. In case of error, the global int 
        variable errno (in errno.h) contains an ERROR code which further 
        identifies the error.

   In the following, we shall discuss these syscalls:
      fork(), wait(), exec(), exit(), chdir(), open(), close() 

5. Process Management in Unix:

5-1. PROC structure in Kernel
     Each process is represented by a PROC structure in the OS kernel. The PROC
     is a data structure 

     typedef  struct proc{
              struct proc * next;
              int pid;         // process pid
              int ppid;        // parent pid
              int status;      // FREE|READY|RUNNING|SLEEP|STOPPED|ZOMBIE, etc.
           
              (many other fileds)
 
              OFT fd[NFD];     // opened file descriptors
     }PROC;


5-2. fork():  Usage:   int pid = fork();
     fork() creates a child process and returns the child's pid or -1 if error.
     The following diagram shows the actions of fork().


               PROCi                      |      PROCj
              --------                    |      -------
    Kmode :    Kcodei   kfork(){....}     |                    ( When Pj runs:)
               Kdatai        ^       |    |                          |
               kstacki       |       |    |      Kstackj             V
   ========================  |  ==== | ===========================   | =======
    Umode :    Ucodei  pid=fork(); <-     |      Ucodej  pid=fork();<-
               Udatai                     |      Udataj
               Ustacki                    |      Ustackj


   (1). The left-hand side shows the images of a process Pi, which issues
        the syscall   pid=fork();    
   (2). Pi goes to Kmode to execute the corresponding kfork() function in kernel
        in which it creates a child process PROCj with Kstackj and Umode image 
        of Pj, as shown in the right hand side of the diagram.
 
        The Umode image of Pj is an IDENTICAL copy of Pi's Umode image.

        Thus, Pj's Ucodej also has the statement
                   pid=fork();

   (3). After creating Pj, Pi returns to the statement  
              pid = fork();
        in Ucodei with the child's pid = j.

   (4). When Pj begins to run, it exits Kmode and returns to the same statement
              pid = fork();
        with a 0 value in ITS OWN Umode image. 

   Example 1: Consider the C program:

        main()
        {
           int pid;
           printf("THIS IS %d  MY PARENT=%d\n", getpid(), getppid()); 

           pid = fork();   // fork syscall; parent returns child pid, 
                           //               child returns 0

           if (pid < 0){   // fork() may fail. e.g. no more PROC in Kernel
               perror("fork faild");
               exit(1);
           }
           
           if (pid){ // PARENT EXECUTES THIS PART 
                  printf("THIS IS %d  MY PARENT=%d\n", getpid(), getppid());
           } 
           else{ // child executes this part
                  printf("I am    %d  my parent=%d\n", getpid(), getppid());
           }
        }

                                                        
5-3. pid = wait(int *status);  // int status in parent's image 
                                                             HI   LOW
     wait() returns a dead child's pid and its exit status=[exit#|sig#]
            As usual, it returns -1 if error, e.g. caller has no child.

     Note:  if caller has more than one child, wait() returns ANY dead child.
               exit# is the exit(VALUE) used by child to die,
               sig#  is the (signal) number that caused the child to die.
            ONLY one of the numbers will be present, WHY?

     main()
     {
       int pid, status;
       pid = fork();
       if (pid){ // PARENT:
           printf("PARENT %d WAITS FOR CHILD %d TO DIE\n", getpid(),pid);
           pid=wait(&status);
           printf("DEAD CHILD=%d, HOW=%04x\n", pid, status);
       }
       else{// child:
           printf("child %d dies by exit(VALUE)\n", getpid());
           exit(100);  //OR {int a,b; a=b/0;} ==> see how does it die
       }
     }

5-4. Execution Order:
     After fork(), the child process competes with all other READY processes
     for CPU time to run. Which process will run next depends on their 
     scheduling prioirty, which changes dynamically.
 
     main()
     {
        int pid;
        pid=fork();
        if (pid){ // PARENT
           printf("PARENT %d DYING\n", getpid());
        }
        else{ // child
               printf("child %d sleeps for 2 seconds\n");
               sleep(2); // sleep for 2 seconds ==> PARENT DIES FIRST
               printf("child %d my parent=%d\n", getpid(), getppid());
        }
     }

5-5. Parent Process
     When a process dies (in Kmode), it becomes a ZOMBIE, i.e. its PROC is 
     marked as ZOMBIE and contains information, such as its exit value. When the
     parent process finds a ZOMBIE child (by wait() syscall), it collects the 
     needed information from the ZOMBIE PROC and finally lay the dead body to 
     rest, i.e. set the ZOMBIE PROC to FREE for recycle again. Thus, a process
     MUST have a parent at all times. However, because of the (independent) 
     process execution order, a process with children may die first. Similar 
     to humman society, such children are called orphans. The natural question
     is: who should be the "parent" of such orphans? In humman society, they 
     would be sent to grandma's house. But what if gradma also died? In Unix,
     the parent of all orphans is P1. Thus, P1 wears many hats:
    =================================================================
         It's the grand dad of ALL user processes. 
         It's the head of an orphange, 
         It's the manager of a morgue (which buries DEAD bodies). 
   ==================================================================
                  
5-5. nice(VALUE); 
     Decrease caller's scheduling priority by VALUE, allowing other processes
     to run first.

6. Change Execution Image:

   A process may use exec() to change its USER mode image to another 
   (executable) file. The exec() library functions have several members:
 
     int execl( const char *path, const char *arg, ...);
     int execlp(const char *file, const char *arg, ...);
     int execle(const char *path, const char *arg , ..., char *const envp[]);
     int execv( const char *path, char *const argv[]);
     int execvp(const char *file, char *const argv[]);

   All of them eventually issue the syscall

     int execve(const char *filename, char *const argv[], char *const envp[]);

   where filename must be a complete pathname (not a name relative to CWD).

   This is the basis of the C function

         main(int argc, char *argv[], char *env[])


   If successful, exec("filename",....) replaces the current Umode image with
   a new image generated from the executable filename. It's the SAME process 
   but with a new Umode image. The old Umode image is abandoned and therefore
   never returned to, unless exec() fails, e.g. filename is non-executable.

   This is similar to a person who goes to Heaven (Kernel) from where he/she
   builds a new house on Earth (Umode), burns down the old house (IRS allows 
   only one house per person?) and returns to the new house to begin a new life.
   Naturally, the person must return to the same old house if the new house 
   cannot be built, else he/she would be homeless and end up on the street.
    
Example #1 : Use execl(), which is of the form 
                     
             execl("a.out", "a.out", string1, string2, ..., 0);

----------- cc to a.out ---------------------------------
 main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
  printf("THIS IS %d IN %s\n", getpid(), argv[0]);
  execl("b.out", "b.out", "hi", 0);
  printf("SHOUDL NOT SEE THIS LINE\n");
}  

----------- cc to b.out ---------------------------------
main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
  printf("this is %d in %s\n", getpid(), argv[0]);
  while(1);
}
----------------------------------------------------------

7. I/O Redirection:

7-1. Stream FILEs and File Descriptors:
   Recall that the sh process has 3 file streams: stdin, stdout, stderr.
   Each file stream is a pointer to a FILE structure in the HEAP area.

   FILE *stdin --->   FILE structure
                    ----------------------------------
                     char fbuf[   ]
                     int counter,head, etc.
                     int fd = 0; // file descriptor; fd[0] in PROC ==> KEYBOARD
                    ----------------------------------

   FILE *stdout --->  FILE structure
                    ----------------------------------
                     char fbuf[   ]
                     int counter,head, etc.
                     int fd = 1; // file descriptor; fd[1] in PROC ==> SCREEN
                    ----------------------------------

   FILE *stderr --->  FILE structure
                    ----------------------------------
                     char fbuf[   ]
                     int counter,head, etc.
                     int fd = 2; // file descriptor; fd[2] in PROC ==> SCREEN
                    ----------------------------------

   When sh forks a child, the child process also has the same FILE streams.
   Each of the FILE streams corresponds to an opened file in the Unix kernel.
   Each opened file has a unique file descriptor (number). The file descriptors
   of stdin,stdout,stderr are 0,1,2, respectively.

7-2. Stream I/O and System Call:

   When a process executes        scanf("format", &item);
   it tries to input an item from stdin, which points to a FILE struct. If the
   FILE struct's fbuf[ ] is empty, it issues a system call to the Unix kernel,
   to READ data from the file descriptor 0, which is mapped to the KEYBOARD of 
   the terminal (/dev/ttyX) of the sh process.

                      REDIRECT INPUT: 
   The FILE struct of stdin contains a file descriptor 0. If we replace the 
   file descriptor 0 with a newly opened file, inputs would come from that file
   rather than from the original input file (the KBD). Thus, if we do 
   
           #include &lt;fcntl.h>  // contains O_RDONLY, O_WRONLY,O_APPEND, etc

           close(0);    // system call to close file descriptor 0
           open("filename", O_RDONLY);  // open filename for READ, which
                                        // will replace fd 0
   Then, every scanf() call will get inputs from the opened file.

   Similarly, when a process executes      printf("format", items);
   it tries to write to the fbuf[] in the stdout FILE structure. If fbuf[] is 
   full, it issues system call to the Unix kernel to write data from fbuf[] to 
   file descriptor 1, which is mapped to the terminal's screen.

                       REDIRECT OUTPUT: 
           close(1);
           open("filename", O_WRONLY|O_CREAT, 0644); 
   
   which change file descriptor 1 to point to filename, then the outputs will 
   go to that file instead of the screen. 
  
   When a process dies (in Kernel), it cloes all opened files, (causing
   data to be written out to disk.

7-3 Use man open to read more on how to issue syscalls 
        open(), read(), write(), close(), 
    and (I/O library functions)
        fopen(), fclose()
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

8. PIPEs:
   In Unix/Linux, the command
                  cmd1 | cmd2 
   runs cmd1 by a process and cmd2 by another process, which are connected by a
   PIPE, so that the outputs of cm1 becomes the inputs of cmd2.

Examples:
         cat filename | grep "test"   # show lines containing test
         ps x | grep "httpd"          # show lines containing httpd

      
8-1. Pipe: 
     A pipe has a read end and a write end.
     A process writes to the pipe, and another process reads from the pipe.

       Proc1:                                            Proc2:
       write ===================>|PIPE| ===============> read 

      -----------------------------------------------------------------    
       while(1){                   |          while(1){
         if (PIPE has NO READER)   |             if (no WRITER && no data)
            exit(BORKEN_PIPE);     |                return 0;
         wait for room in PIPE;    |             wait for data in PIPE; 
         write to pipe;            |             return n=read from PIPE; 
       }                           |          }
      -----------------------------------------------------------------        

8-2. Pipe Programming Example:

     int pd[2];       // 2 integers
     char buf[1024];

     main()
     {
       int r, n, pid;
  
       r = pipe(pd);  // system call to create a pipe' pd[0]=READ, pd[1]=WRITE
       printf("pd=[%d, %d]\n", pd[0], pd[1]);
 
       pid = fork();    // fork a child process, which has the SAME pd[ ]
       if (pid){        // parent as pipe WRITER
	  close(pd[0]); // close its READ end
          
	 n = write(pd[1], "I AM YOUR PAPA", 16);
	 printf("parent %d wrote %d bytes to pipe\n", getpid(), n);

       }
       else{            // child as pipe READER
           close(pd[1]);
           n = read(pd[0], buf, 1024);
           printf("child  %d read  %d bytes from pipe: %s\n", getpid(), n, buf);
       }
     }

--------------------- outputs of running a.out ---------------------
     pd=[3, 4]
     child  14923 read  16 bytes from pipe: I AM YOUR PAPA
     parent 14922 wrote 16 bytes to pipe
--------------------------------------------------------------------

8-3. Connect PIPE writer to PIPE reader:

Assume:  cmd1 | cmd2

(1). When sh gets the command line  cmd1 | cmd2, it forks a child sh and waits 
     for the child sh to die as usual.

(2). Child sh: scan the command line for | symbol. In this case 
                    cmd1 | cmd2 
     has a pipe symbol |.  Divide the command line into head=cmd1, tail=cmd2

(3). Then the Child sh :

           int pd[2];

           pipe(pd);       // creates a PIPE

           pid = fork();   // fork a child (to share the PIPE)

           if (pid){  // parent as pipe WRITER
              close(pd[0]);// WRITER MUST close pd[0]

              close(1);    // close 1
              dup(pd[1]);  // replace 1 with pd[1]
              exec(head);  // change image to cmd1
           }
           else{      // child as pipe READER
              close(pd[1]); // READER MUST close pd[1]

              close(0);  
              dup(pd[0]);   // replace 0 with pd[0]
              exec(tail);   // change image to cmd2
           }
