<H1>360 NOTES #2 : PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT</H1>

<Pre>

1. OBJECTIVES
   To understand the steps involved in program development.

2. THE STEPS:

(1). Source file : A text editor, such as vi or emacs, may be used to create
     one or more source program files in some language(s). Typical languages
     are C and Assembly.

(2). Consider C programs first. Let the source of a C program be written as
     two files, t1.c and t2.c,  as shown below:
   
    /********  t1.c file ***********************************************/
     int g = 100;                       /* initialized global variable */
     int h;                             /* un-initialized global variable */
     static int s;                      /* static global variable */

     main(int argc, char *argv[ ])      /* main function */
     {
       int a = 1; int b;                /* automatic local variables */
       static int c = 3;                /* static local variable */
       b = 2;
       c = mysum(a,b);                  /* call mysum(), passing a,b */
       printf("sum=%d g=%d\n",c, g);    /* call printf() */
     }

     /*******  t2.c file *******************************************/
     extern int g;                      /* extern global variable  */
     int mysum(int x, int y)            /* function heading */
     {  
        return x + y + g;                   
     }              


Variables in a C program can be classified as

                           |-- non-static --|
                |- global -|                |- initialized or uninitialized
                |          |-- static ------|
     Variables -|                          
                |- local --|-- register-----|- in CPU register (if possible)
                           |-- automatic ---|- allocated on stack
                           |-- static ------|- initialized or uninitialized

Global variables are defined outside of any function. Local variables are 
defined inside a function. Usually, the term "static" means a permanent and 
unique copy. So global variables are already static. Then why static globals? 
In C programs, static global variables are visible only to the file in which 
they are defined. Non-static globals are visible to all the files of the same 
program. Global variables can be initialized or uninitialized. Initialized 
globals are assigned values at compile time. Uninitialized globals are set to 0
when the program execution starts. Local variables are visible only to the 
function in which they are defined. By default, local variables are automatic;
they come into existence when the function is entered and they logically 
disappear when the function exits. For register variables, the compiler tries to
allocate them in CPU registers. Since automatic local variables do not have any
allocated memory space until the function is entered, they cannot be initialized
at compile time. Static locals have only one copy and can be initialized. In 
addition, C also supports volatile variables, which are used as memory-mapped 
I/O locations or globals that are changed by interrupt handlers or by multiple 
threads. The volatile keyword prevents the compiler from optimizing the source 
code that operates on such variables.

    For example, in the above t1.c file g is an initialized global, h is an 
uninitialized global and s is a static global. Both g and h are visible to the
entire program but s is visible only in t1.c. So t2.c can reference g by 
declaring it as extern, but it cannot reference s because s is a static global,
which is visible only in t1.c. In the main() function, the local variables a, b
are automatic and c is static. Although a is defined as int a = 1, this is not 
an initialization because a does not yet exist at compile time. Instead, the 
generated code will assign 1 to the current copy of a when main() is actually 
entered.


(3). To convert these source files into an executable, we typically use the 
     cc command (In Linux, cc is linked to gcc, so they are the same).

        cc  t1.c t2.c       =====> this generates an executable file  a.out

(4). WHAT'S cc or gcc?
     cc is a program, which consists of 3 major steps:
     
     1. Convert C source files to Assembly code files:
        The first step of cc is to invoke the C COMPILER, which translates
        the .c files into .s files containing ASSEMBLY code for the 
        target machine.  

     2. Convert ASSEMBLY Code to OBJECT code:
        Every machine has its own set of machine instructions. Users may 
        write programs in an ASSEMBLY language for a specific machine.

        An ASSEMBLER is a program, which translates assembly code into 
        machine code in binary form. The resulting .o files are called 
        OBJECT code. 

        The second step of cc is to invoke the ASSEMBLER to translate the
        .s files into .o files.

        Each .o file consists of 3 parts:
         
              a CODE section consisting of machine instructions;
              a DATA section consisting of all GLOBAL and static variables; 
              a SymbolTable  containing all variable and function names
                             and their attributes.

     3. LINKING: 
        A program may be composed of several pieces of .o files, which are 
        usually dependent on one another.  In addition, the .o files may call
        C library functions (e.g. printf), which are NOT present.

        The last step of cc is to invoke the LINKER, which puts all the .o 
        files and the needed library functions together into a single 
        executable binary file, a.out. More specifically, the LINKER does the 
        following:

        .Combine all the code sections of the individual .o files into a
         single CODE section,

        .Combine all the data sections into a single DATA section,

        .Combine all the bss  sections into a single BSS  section,

        .Adjust pointers in the combined CODE section and offsets in the 
         combined BSS section

        .Use the SymbolTable to resolve the cross references among the
         inidvidual .o files. 

         For instance, when the compiler sees sum = mysum(a,b), it does NOT 
         know where mysum is. So it leaves a blank in the .o file for the
         entry address of mysum. When the linker puts t1.o t2.o together, it 
         knows where mysum is since mysum is recorded in the SymbolTable
         of t2.o. So the linker can replace the blank in t1.o with the address
         of mysum. Similarly for other symbols that are cross referenced.

        If everything goes well, the linker will write the resulting combined 
        file as a.out, which is the executable binary.
 
3. STATIC Vs. DYNAMIC Linking:
   There are two ways to create a.out, known as static and dynamic linking.
   In static linking, the linker includes every needed library function in 
   a.out. This makes a.out self-sufficient but usually very large.
     
   In dynamic linking, the library functions are not included in a.out but 
   calls to such functions are recorded in a.out as a directives to the LOADER.
   When a.out is to be executed, the system LOADER will load both a.out and 
   its needed libaray files into memory. 

   The main advantages of dynamic linking are:
       .The size of every a.out is reduced.
       .Once loaded into memory, the library functions can be SHARED.
      . Modifying library functions does not have to re-linking any a.out file.
 
   This kind of libraries are known as Dynamic Linking Libraries (DLLs).

4. WHAT's in a.out?
   a.out is the executable binary file, which usually has the format:
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
     header      : The header of a.out contains its sizes in bytes: 
                       tsize = size of Code section;
                       dsize = size of Data section;
                       bss_size=size of bss section;
                       Needed library functions (if dynamic linked).

     Code Section: this is the combined code area of a.out; it always begins
                   with the standard C startup file crt0.o, which calls main. 

     Data Section: The Data section contains INITIALIZED global and static data
                   objects. Examples of static data are static variables and 
                   format strings in printf(fmt, .....).

     bss (Block Started by Symbol) Section: un-initialized statics and globals
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   NOTE that the bss section is NOT included in a.out. However, its size
   is recorded in the header of a.out as bss_size.

5. Execution of a.out
   The sh command
       %  a.out ONE TWO THREE 
   executes a.out with the strings ONE TWO THREE as command-line parameters.
   As explained before, sh will create a child process to execute a.out.
   
   After creation, The child process does the following

   (1). It reads the header of a.out to determine the Total memroy size needed:
             TotalSize = tsize + dsize + bss_size + stackSize
        where the stackSize is usually a default value of say, 4K bytes.

   (2). It then allocates a memory area of TotalSize bytes. Conceptually, we
        may assume that the allocated memory area is a single piece of
        contiguous memory. It then loads a.out (without the header) into this 
        memroy area, with the Code section at the Low address end. The High
        address end will be the stack area. Thus, the stack grows downward.

   (3). The main() function of  a.out  may be written as 
              main(int argc, char *argv[ ], char *env[ ])
        As will be shown later, parameters are passed through the stack. 

   (4). It then starts to execute crt0.o, whcih calls main().
  
   (5). The execution image of a process is shown by the figure:

                      |<-- a.out -->|bss  |
                      ---------------------
                      | Code  |Data |
                      ---------------
  
          LowAddress  --------------|---------------------   HighAddress 
                      | CODE  |Data |bss=0| HEAP | STACK |
                      --------------------|---------------

        where the HEAP is for dynamic memory allocations (by malloc() in C or
        new() in C++) and STACK is the run-time stack.
        Subject to a certain maximum size limit, both HEAP and STACK may be 
        expanded automatically by the Unix operating system.

   (6). Termination:
        The process that executes a.out may terminate in ONE of 4 ways:

        1. The process calls exit(bye_value), which does some clean-up work 
           (such as flush stdout, close I/O stream FILEs) and then issues an 
           _exit(value) system call, which causes the process to enter the Unix
           Kernel to die. For instance, when the process return from main() to
           crt0.o, it calls exit(0). Alternatively, the process may call
           exit(byte_value) anywhere in a.out to terminate (without going back
           to crt0.o). 

        2. Inside a.out, the process may call _exit(value) anywhere to enter 
           Kernel to die IMMEDIATELY. Reason: if you want to die in a such a 
           hurry, why bother to clean up your room first?
           
           When a process dies, it records the byte_value in the _exit() call
           as the "cause of death" on its body, notifies its parent that it is
           dying and then becomes a ZOMBIE. The parent (either the original 
           parent or P1) will find the ZOMBIE, get its pid and "cause of death"
           value via the 
                         dead_child_pid = wait(&cause_of_death);
           system call, where cause_of_death has 2 bytes containing
                              |exitValue|signal#|
           Naturally, only one of the bytes would be non-zero, WHY?

        3. While executing, the process encounters an error (in YOUR a.out of
           course), which is recognized and "caught" by the CPU. The process is
           forced into the Unix kernel by a "trap". Once in kernel, it converts
           the trap error (type) into a magic number called a SIGNAL number and
           delivers the signal to itself, causing it to die. In this case, the
           ZOMBIE's "cause of death" is the signal number, and we may say that
           the process has died abnormally. 

           Examples: Try to run these C programs
                      int *p;
                      main(){   *p = 1;  }

                      int a,b,c;
                      main(){   c = a/b; }

                      main(){   main();  }

           What do you see and WHY?


        4. Killed by a signal, which may originate from hardware (interrupts)
           or sent by another process via the 
                      kill pid 
           command, which uses the kill(pid, singal#) system call.
           Example:  If you run the C program:
                        main()
                        {
                           while(1);
                        }       
           What would happen and how do you get out the mess?
