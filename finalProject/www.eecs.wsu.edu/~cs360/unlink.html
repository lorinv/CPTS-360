                        HOW TO unlink
===========================================================================
                       unlink pathname

(1). get pathname's INODE into memory

(2). verify it's a FILE (REG or LNK), can not be a DIR; 

(3). decrement INODE's i_links_count by 1;

(4). if i_links_count == 0 ==> rm pathname by

        deallocate its data blocks by:

     Write a truncate(INODE) function, which deallocates ALL the data blocks
     of INODE. This is similar to print data blocks of INODE.

        deallocate its INODE;
     
(5). Remove childName=basename(pathname) from the parent directory by

        rm_child(parentInodePtr, childName)

     which is the SAME as that in rmdir or unlink file operations.
