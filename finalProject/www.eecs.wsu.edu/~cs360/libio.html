           CS 360 NOTES on  Library I/O Functions

1. WHY Library I/O functions?

   Although system calls are the basis for read/write files, they are often
   inconvenient to use. For examples, users may wish to read/write files in 
   logical units most suited to the application, e.g. as lines, chars, etc. 

   Library I/O functions are provided for this purpose. Although not 
   absolutely essential, they provide added convenience and overall 
   efficiency.

2. What are Library I/O functions?

   Almost every OS that supports C also provides Library functions for
   file I/O.  In Unix, Library I/O functions are built on top of the 
   syscall functions. In order to illustrate their intimate relationship, 
   we first list a few of them:
      
    Syscall Functions:  open(),  read(),  write(), lseek(),  close();
    Library Functions; fopen(), fread(), fwrite(), fseek(), fclose();

   From their strong similrities, you can almost guess that every library 
   I/O function has its root in a corresponding syscall function. This is
   indeed the case as fopen() relies on open(), fread() makes use of read(),
   etc. The following C programs illutrate their usage.

             Example 1: Display the contents of a file

}                                    |   } 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
           Both programs prints the contents of a file to stdout

          then print each buf[i]     |         the FILE struct, print it.
                                     |  The LIBIO function will "refill" the
                                     |  buffer when it becomes empty.

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Both programs copy file1 to file2. Since you already know how syscalls
    work, we shall only discuss the program that uses Library I/O functions.

    (1). fopen() uses a string for Mode, where "r" stands for READ, "w" for 
         WRITE. It returns a pointer to a FILE structure. The FILE structure 
         contains a buffer, whose size usually matches that of BLKSIZE. In 
         addition, it also has pointers, counters and status variables for 
         manipulating the buffer.

         fopen() first allocates and initialize a FILE structure in (heap area
         of) the UserImage. It then issues an open() syscall for the file. If 
         the open() syscall succeeds, it records the returned fd in the FILE 
         structure, and returns a pointer to the FILE structure. Otherwise, it
         frees the FILE structure and returns a NULL pointer.

         It is important to note that the FILE structure, which is allocated/
         freed dynamically, is in the process' UserImage. This means that calls
         to Library I/O functions are ordinary function calls, not syscalls.  
         
    (2). The programs terminates if any of the fopen() calls has failed. As 
         mentioned above, fopen() returns a NULL pointer on failure.

    (3). Then it uses a while loop to copy the file.  Each iteration of the
         while loop tries to read BLKSIZE bytes from the source file, and 
         write n bytes to the target file, where n is the returned value from 
         fread().

         The general forms of fread() and fwrite() are

                 n = fread(buffer, size, nitems, FILEptr);
                 n = fwrite(buffer,size, nitems, FILEptr);
         
         where size is the data object size in bytes,  nitems is the number of 
         data objects to be READ or WRITTEN, and n is the actual number of 
         objects read or written. These functions are intended for R/W 
         structured data objects. For example, suppose that the buffer area 
         contains data objects of the type
                     struct OBJECT{.....}
         We may use 
                 n = fwrite(buffer, sizeof(struct OBJEC), M, FILEptr);
         to wirte M objects to a file.  Similarly,
                 n = fread(buffer, sizeof(struct OBJECT), N, FILEptr);
         reads N such objects from a file.

         The above program tries to read/write BLKSIZE bytes at a time. So, it
         has size = 1 and nitems = BLKSIZE. As a matter of fact, any comination
         of size and nitems such that size*nitems = BLKSIZE would also works. 
         However, using a size > 1 may cause problem on the last fread() 
         because the file may have fewer than size bytes left. In that case, 
         the returned n is zero but there are still bytes remaining. To deal 
         with the "tail" part of the surce file, we may add the following 
         lines of code after the while loop:
                 
                 fseek(fp, (long)total, 0);
                 n = fread(buf, 1, size, fp);
                     fwrite(buf,1, n, gp);
                 total += n;
         
         fseek() works in exactly the same way as lseek(). It positions the 
         file's R/W pointer to the byte location total. From there, we read 
         the file as 1-byte objects. This will read all the remaining bytes 
         and write them to the target file.

    (4). After the copying is done, both files are closed by calling fclose().


3. Algorithms of fread(), fwrite() and fclose()

3-1. The algorithm of fread() is as follows:

     (1). On the first call to fread(), the FILE structure's buffer is empty.
          fread() uses the saved file descriptor fd to issue a
                  n = read(fd, fbuffer, BLKSIZE);
          syscall to fill the local fbuffer. Then, it initializes fbuffer's 
          pointers, counters and status variables to indicate that there is a 
          block full of data in the local buffer.
          It then tries to satisfy the fread() call from the local buffer by 
          copying data to the program's buffer area. If the local buffer does 
          not have enough data, it issues additional read() syscalls to fill 
          the local buffer, until the needed number of bytes is satisfied (or 
          end of file is reached). After copying data to the program's buffer 
          area, it updates the local buffer's pointers, counters, etc. getting
          ready for next fread() request.  It then returns the acutal number of
          objects read to the calling place.

     (2). On each subsequent call to fread(), it tries to satisfy the call from
          the FILE structure's local buffer. It issues a read() syscall to 
          refill the local buffer whenever the buffer becomes empty.

          Thus, fopen() accepts calls from user program on one side and issues
          read() syscalls to the Kenrel on the other. Except for the read() 
          syscalls, all processing of fread() are performed in the User Mode. 
          It enters the Kernel mode only when needed and it does so in a way 
          that matches the Kernel's behavior for best efficiency. It provides 
          automatic buffering mechanism so that user programs do not have to 
          worry about such detailed operations.

3-2 fwrite():
 
     The algorithm of fwrite() is similar to that of fread() except for the 
     data movement direction.  Initially the FILE structure's local buffer is 
     empty. On each call to fwrite(), it writes data to the local buffer, and 
     adjust the buffer's pointers, counters and status variable to keep track 
     of the number of bytes in the buffer. If the buffer becomes full, it 
     issues a write() syscall to write the entire buffer to Kernel. 
     
3-3. USE syscalls OR Library Functions?
          
     Based on the above discussion, we can now answer the question of whether 
     to use syscalls or Libray functions to do file I/O?

     fread() relies on read() to copy data from Kernel to the local buffer,
     from which it copies data to the program's buf area. In contrast, read() 
     copies data from Kernel directly to the program's buf area.  Thus, for 
     read/write data in units of BLKSIZEs, read() is inherently more efficient
     than fread() because it only needs one copying operation instead of two. 
     Therefore, in the above C programs, the one that uses syscalls is actually
     more efficient than the other that uses Library I/O functions.  However, 
     if the read/write is not in units of BLKSIZE, fread() and fwrite() may be
     far more efficient. For example, if we insists on R/W one byte at a time,
     fread() and fwrite() would be far better because they enter Kernel Mode 
     only to fill or flush the local buffer, not on every byte. Here, we have 
     implicitly assumed that entering Kernel mode is more expensive than 
     staying in User mode. This is indeed true. 

3-4. Algorithm of fclose():

     fclose() first flushes the local buffer if the file was opened for WRITE.
     Then it issues a close() syscall to close the file descriptor.  Finally 
     it frees the FILE structure and resets the FILE pointer to NULL.

3-5. Other Modes for fopen():

     The Mode parameter in fopen() may be specified as

       "r", "w", "a" : for READ, WRITE, APPEND, or with a +, which means to 
                       create the file if it does not exist.
       "r+" : for R/W, without truncating the file.
       "w+" : for R/W, but truncate the file first.
       "a+" : for R/W by appending.

     However, when a file is fopened for both R/W, there may be restrictions on
     the use of mixed fread() and fwrite() calls. The specification requires 
     that at least one fseek() or ftell() be used between every pair of fread()
     and fwrite(). 

     Example: This program yields different results when run under HP Unix and 
              Linux.

              #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
              FILE fp; char buf[1024]; 
              main()
              { 
                  fp = fopen("t.c", "r+");   /* for both R/W */
                  fread(buf, 1, 20, fp);     /* read 20 bytes */ 
                  fwrite(buf,1, 20, fp);     /* write to the same file */
              }


     Linux gives the right result, which modifies the bytes from 20 to 39. But
     HP Unix appends 40 bytes to the end of the original file.

     The difference stems from the non-uniform treatment of R/W pointers in the
     two systems.  Recall that fread()/fwrite() issue read()/write() syscalls
     to fill/flush the local buffer.  While read()/write() use the R/W pointer 
     in the file's OFTE, fread()/fwrite() use the local buffer's R/W pointer in
     the FILE structure.  Without a fseek() to synchronize these two pointers,
     the results depend on how are they used in the implementations. In order 
     avoid any inconsistencies, follow the man pages. For the example program, 
     the results become idnetical (and correct) if you insert a line

                  fseek(fp, (long)20, 0);

     between the fread() and fwrite().

4. Additional Library I/O functions:

4-1. Line mode I/O:
          retString = fgets(buf,nchars,fp); 
          retString = fputs(string,fp);
     Examples:
          #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
          FILE *fp,*gp;
          char buf[256]; char *s="this is a string";
          main()
          {
             fp = fopen("source", "r");
             gp = fopen("target", "w");
             fgets(buf, 256, fp);    /* read a line of upto 255 chars to buf */
             fputs(buf, 256, gp);    /* write string to target file */

          }
    
     When fp is stdin or stdout, fgets() and fputs() are shortened to
             gets(buf);     /* assume char buf[] is big enough */
             puts(string);  /* print string to stdout */

4-2. Char Mode I/O:
          int c;         /* NOTE the int type */       
          c = getc(fp);  /* get a char from fp, return EOF on end of file */
              ungetc(c, fp); /* push c back to stream */

          putc(c, fp);   /* put a char to fp */
     
     The reason for the int type of c is that the EOF symbol is usually an int
     value. 

   For fp = stdin or stdout,  c = getchar();  putchar(c); may be used instead.
   For run time efficiency, getchar() and putchar() are often NOT the shortened
   versions of getc() and putc(). Instead, they may be implemented as Macros
   in order to avoid an extra function call.
   Examples:

     (1). /* file copy using getc(), putc() */
          #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
          FILE *fp,*gp;
          main()
          {
            int c;  /* for testing EOF */
            fp=fopen("source", "r");
            gp=fopen("target", "w");
            while ( (c=getc(fp)) != EOF )
               putc(c,gp);
            fclose(fp); fclose(gp);
          }

    (2). /* Linux's man pages contain lots of 0x08 code. It is used as follows:
             0x08TT0x08HH0x08II0x08SS  high light the word THIS.
             t_0x08h_0x08a_0x08t_0x08  display the _ under that.
             However, a _ not immediately followed by 0x08 is part of the text.

             The following program eliminates the 0x08 code from the outputs 
             of man. EXPLAIN HOW DOES IT WORK ? */

             #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
             main()
             {  int c, nextc;
                while ( (c=getchar()) != EOF ){
                   if (c == 0x08){
                       c = getchar();
                       continue;
                   }
                   if (c == '_'){
                       nextc=getchar();
                       if (nextc == 0x08)
                       continue;
                       ungetc(nextc,stdin);
                   }
                   putchar(c); 
                }
             }


4-3. FORMATTED I/O:
     These are perhaps the most commonly used I/O functions.
     Foratted Inputs: ( FMT=format string )
                      scanf(FMT, &items);    /* from stdin */     
                     fscanf(fp, FMT, &items);
                     sscanf(buf,FMT, &items);  
     Formatted Outputs:     
                      printf(FMT, items);   /* to stdouot */
                     fprintf(fp, FMT, items);
                     sprintf(buf,FMT, items);
     
     Note that sscanf() and sprintf() are not really I/O functions but
     string assemble/extraction funcions.
      

4-4. Other Functions:

     fseek(), ftell(), rewind()
     feof(), ferr(), fileno()

     freopen(), fdopen()
     setbuf(), setvbuf()
     popen()
