<H1>360 NOTES #10 Sh Programming</H1>

<Pre>
1. sh scripts:
   A sh script is a text file containing sh statements for sh to execute.
   Example: Text edit a file, mysh,  containing
            -----------------------------------
            #! /bin/bash
            # comment line
            echo hello
            -----------------------------------
   Use chmod +x mysh to make it executable. Then run mysh. It will print hello.

2. sh Statements: 
   sh statements include all Unix commands, with I/O re-directions.
     Examples:    echo abc     ==> abc 
                  ls           ;   ls > outfile 
                  date         
                  cp f1 f2
                  mkdir new
                  cat filename
         
3. Command-line parameters:
   Similar to running C programs, sh scripts can be invoked with parameters, 
   as in      mysh one two three

   $# = the number of such parameters, which are known as $1 to $9. $0 is the
        program name itself.
   $* = ALL command-line parameter (strings) $1 $2 ....

4. Sh Variables:
   Sh has many built-in variables, e.g. PATH, HOME.
   You may use any symbol as sh variable. No declaration is necessary.
   sh variable values are STRINGs !!! If A is a variable, $A is its value.
   Examples
      echo A   ==>  A
      echo $A  ==>        (null string if A is not set)
      A="this is fun"     # set A value
      echo $A  ==> this is fun
      B=A
      echo $B   ==> A     (B was assigned the string "A")
      B=$A                (B takes the VALUE of A)
      echo $B   ==> this is fun

      echo -n "enter yes or no "
      read ANS             # sh reads a line from stdin;
      echo $ANS

      local X             # X is local to this sh; not available in child sh
      export Y            # variable Y will be passed to child sh process

5. Quotes:
   Sh has many special chars, such as $, /, *, >, <, etc.  
   To use these as ordinary chars, use \ to quote them, as in
         echo \$A     ==> $A
     OR  echo '$A'    ==> $A    (NO substitution within SINGLE quotes)

         echo " this is $A"     (DOUBLE quotes will substitute $A !!!)

6. Command Substitution:
     When sh sees $(cmd), it executes cmd first, and SUSTITUTEs $(cmd)
     with the RESULT (string) of the execution.

     echo $(date)       ==> display current date string

     NAMES=$(ls ./)
     echo $NAMES

7. sh control statements
7-1. if-else-fi statement
     if [ condition ]
       then
          statements
       else                # as usual, the else part is optional
          statements
     fi

 $# is the number of command line parameters, which are known as 
 $1,$2,$3,...., $9    As usual, $0 is the name of the execcutable itself.

 By default, all values in sh are strings, so they can be compared by
  if [ s1 = s2 ];  if [ s1 != s2 ];   if [ s1 \< s2 ]; if [ s1 \> s2 ]; etc.
 Note the spaces between the tokens

 In contrast, the operators -eq, -ne, -lt, -gt compare them as (integer)
 NUMBERS, thus
   if [ "123" = "0123" ]  is false (since they differ as strings)
   if [ "123" -eq "0123" ] is true. 


 In sh, the following tests can be used:
 if [ -e name ]      test whether file name exists
 if [ -f name ]      test whether name is a (REG) file
 if [ -d name ]      test whether name is a DIR
 if [ -r name ]      test whether name is readable; also -w,-x
 if [ f1 -ef f2 ]    test whether f1, f2 are the SAME file


7-2. for statement in sh:

       for VARIABLE in string1 string2,...., stringn
         do
            commands
         done

   Examples:
      for FRUIT in  apple  orange  banana  cherry
        do
           echo $FRUIT    # ===> apple  orange  banana  cherry 
        done 

     ------------------------------------------------------------------
      DIRNAMES=$(ls ./)
      for NAME in DIRNAMES
        do
          if [ -f $NAME ]; then
             echo $NAME is a REG file
          else
             echo $NAME is NOT REG
          fi
        done

      ----------------------------------------------------------------
      for NAME in $* 
        do
          echo $NAME      ==>  all command-line param strings
          if [ -f $NAME ]; then
             echo $NAME is a file
          fi
          if [ -d $NAME ]; then
             echo $NAME is a DIR
          fi
        done
     ----------------------------------------------------------------

7-3. while [ condition ]
       do
          commands
       done

  -------------------------------------------------------------------
                  Example:
   echo '$#' = $#         # echo the number of parameters 
   I=0                    # set I to "0" (STRING !!!!) 
   while [ $1 ]           # while $1 is not the empty string
   do
      echo $1             # echo current $1
      I=$(expr $I + 1)    # use expr to change I from "0" to "1"
      shift               # shift once, $2 becomes $1, $3 becomes $2, ... etc.
   done
          
   echo I = $I            # total number of parameters 
  --------------------------------------------------------------------

7-4 Other Flow-Control statements:

    until [ "$ANS" = "give up" ]
    do
        echo -n "enter your answer : "
        read ANS
    done
   
    case statement (SELF-STUDY)

7-5. break and continue statements:
     They work exactly the same as they do in C

 
8. sh FUNCTIONS (by examples)
    --------------------------------------------------------
     # check_file() is a function, NOT the entry point

              check_file()     
              {
                if [ -f $1 ]; then
                   return 0           # 0 for OK
                fi
                return 1              # 1 for BAD
              }

     # Here is the entry point of the program
     # Usage : thisFile  f1 f2  f3 ......

              for FILE in $*             # for FILE in $1 $2 ....
              do
                  check_file  $FILE      # call check_file() 
                  if [ $? = 0 ]          # returnCode == 0 ?
                     then
                         echo $FILE is a regular file
                     else
                         echo $FILE is not regular
                  fi
              done
     -------------------------------------------------------------
9. I/O Redirection:

   When entering a sh command, we may instruct sh to re-direct I/O
   to files other than the default stdin, stdout, sterr. I/O redirections
   have the following form and meaning:
      -------------------------------------------------
      >  file   stdout goes to file, which will be created if non-existing.
      >> file   stdout append to file
      <  file   use file as stdin; file must exist and have r permission.
 
     << word   take inputs from "here" file until a line containing only 
                "word" is encountered. 
                Try these:
                ---------------------------------------------
                echo << END    
                  keep entering lines until a line with only
                  END
                --------------------------------------------
                cat << DONE
                  keep entering lines until
                DONE
                -------------------------------------------

      >&2      dup (see below) the fd=2 and use the result as stdout.

      <&3      dup fd=3 and use the result as stdin
      --------------------------------------------------
      A digit may preceed any of these to mean: use that fd instead of 
      stdin or stdout.  Examples:
                2> file           stderr to file
                2>> file          stderr append to file
                2>&1              dup 1 and use it as 2 ==> merge 1 and 2

    echo "Silly! we never copy a file to itself"
    return 1

    link=$(readlink $1)
    ln -s $link $2
    return 0

# assume $# = 2

   echo source $1 does not exist
   exit 1

   exit 0
fi

if [ -d $2 ]; then
   cpf2d $1 $2
   exit 0

echo "ALL DONE"
#------------------------------------------------------------------


ASSIGNMENT: Write YOUR sh code for cpd2d(), which copies a directory d1 to
            a directory d2.
HINTS:
     ------------------------------------------------------------------
      DIRNAMES=$(ls $DIR)
      for NAME in DIRNAMES
        do

          else
             echo $NAME is NOT REG
          fi
        done
