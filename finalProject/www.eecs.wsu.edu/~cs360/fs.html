1. File I/O Operations
 
    Figure 1 shows a diagram of file I/O operations. In the diagram, the 
upper part above the double-dashed line represents the kernel space, and the 
lower part represents the user space of a process. The diagram intends to show 
the sequence of actions when a process opens a file stream for read/write, and 
then performs a read or write operation on the file stream. Control flows are 
identified by the labels (1) to (10) in the diagram, which are explained in 
detail following the diagram.

       User Image

------------------------------ User Space -----------------------------------

                 Figure 1. File Operation Diagram

Legends:
--------------------- User Mode Operations -----------------------------------
(1). A process in User mode executes

       FILE *fp = fopen("file", "r"); OR "w", etc.
 
(2). fopen() creates a FILE struct in user (heap) space with a fbuf[BLKSIZE]. 
     fopen() issues  int fd = open("file", O_RDONLY) syscall to Kernel's
     kopen(), which constructs an Opentable pointing to the file's INODE in 
     memory. For non-special files, INODE's i_block[ ] points to data blocks on
     device. On success, fp points at the FILE struct containing fd returned by
     the open() syscall.

(3). fread(ubuf[ ], size, nitem, fp): READ nitem of size each to ubuf[ ] by
      .copy data from FILE struct's fbuf[ ] to ubuf[ ], if enough, return;
      .if fbuf[ ] has no more data, then execute (4a).
      ---------------------------------------------------------------------
(4a). issue read(fd, fbuf[ ], BLKSIZE) syscall to Kernel to read a block to 
      fbuf[ ], then copy data to ubuf[ ] until enough or file has no more data.

(4b). fwrite(ubuf, size, nitem, fp): try copy data to fbuf[ ];
       .if (fbuf[ ] has room): copy data to fbuf[], return;  
       .if (fbuf[ ] is full) : issue write(fd, fbuf, BLKSIZE) syscall to write
                               a block to Kernel, then write to fbuf[ ] again.
  
      fflsuh(fp) ==> write fbuf[ ] to Kernel immediately.

      OTHER Library I/O: fputc(),fgetc(),fgets(),fputs(),fscanf(),fprintf(),etc.
      ALL operate on fbuf[ ] in the FILE struct.

Thus, fread() issues read(), and fwrite() issues write(), syscalls to kernel, 
but they do so only if necessary and they transfer data in chunks of block size
for better efficiency.

=================== Kernel Mode Operations ===================================
(5).File system functions in Kernel.
    Assume read(fd, fbuf[ ], BLKSIZE) syscall of non-special file. 

(6). In a read() syscall, fd is an opened file descriptor, which is an index
     in the running PROc's fd[ ] array. The contents of PROC.fd[fd] points to an
     openTable, which represents the opened file. (7) uses the running PROC's 
     fd[fd] to access the openTable.

(7). The openTable contains the files's open mode, a pointer to the file's INODE
     in memory and the current byte offset into the file for read/write. From 
     the openTable's offset, 
        .Compute logical block number, lbk;
        .Map logical block number, lbk, to physical block number, blk, via 
         INODE's i_block[ ] array at (8).

(8). Minode contains the in-memory INODE of the file. INODE.i_block[ ] contains
     pointers to physical disk blocks. A file system may use the physical block
     numbers to read/write data from/to the disk blocks directly, but these 
     would incur too much physical disk I/O.

(9). In order to improve disk I/O efficiency, most OS kernels use a I/O buffer 
     cache to reduce the number of physical disk I/O.  
       
(9a). For a read(fd, buf, BLKSIZE) syscall, determine the needed (dev, blk) 
      number, then consult the I/O buffer cache to
         . get a buffer = (dev, blk);
         . if (buffer's data are invalid){
               start_io on buffer;
               wait for I/O completion;
           }
         . copy data from buffer to fbuf[ ];
         . release the buffer to the buffer cache.

(9b). For a write(fd, fbuf, BLKSIZE) syscall, determine the needed (dev, blk)
      number, then consult the I/O buffer cache to 
         . get a buffer = (dev, blk);
         . write data to the I/O buffer;
         . mark the buffer as dataValid and DIRTY (for delayed write to disk);
         . release the buffer to the buffer cache.

(10): Device I/O: Physical disk I/O operations on the I/O buffers ultimately go
      through the device driver, which consists of start_io() in the upper half
      and the disk interrupt handler in the lower half of the driver.
 
      ---------------- Upper half of disk driver -----------------
      start_io(bp):  // bp = a locked buffer, in dev_list, opcode=R|W (ASYNC)
      {       
        1. enter bp into dev's I/O_queue;
        2. if (bp is FIRST in I/O_queue)
              issue I/O command to device (hardware);
      }       
      --------------- Lower half of disk driver -----------------
      Device_Interrupt_Handler:
      {  
         get dev from intrruptStatus; 
         bp = dequeue(first buffer from dev.I/O_queue);
         if (bp was READ){
             mark bp dataVALID;
             wakeup/unblock waiting process on bp;
         }
         else      //  assume bp was for delay write
             brelse(bp);

         if (dev.I/O_queue NOT empty)
            issue I/O command for first buffer in dev.I/O_queue;
      }

                Figure 2. EXT2 FS Data Structures

(1) is the PROC structure of the running process. Each PROC has a cwd, which 
points to the in-memory INODE of the PROC's Current Working Directory. 
 
(2) is the root pointer of the file system, which points to the in-memory root 
INODE. When the system starts, one of the devices is chosen as the root device,
which must be a valid EXT2 file system. The root INODE (inode #2) of the root 
device is loaded into memory as the root (/) of the file system. This operation
is known as "mount the root file system". For each mounted file system, an entry
in the mount table, mntTable[ ] shown at (4), is used to record the mounted file
system. In the in-memory INODE of the mount point, the mounted flag is turned on
and the mntabPtr points to the mount table entry. In the corresponding mount 
table entry, mntPointPtr points back at the in-memory INODE of the mount point.
As will be shown later, these doubly-linked pointers allow us to cross mount 
points while traversing the file system tree.

(3) is an openTable entry. When a PROC opens a file, an entry of the PROC's fd[]
array points to an openTable, which points to the in-memory INODE of the opened
file.

(4) is an in-memory INODE. Whenever a file or directory is needed, its INODE
is loaded into a minode[ ] entry for reference. Since INODES are unique, only 
one copy of each INODE can be in memory at any time. In the minode entry, (dev,
ino) identify where the INODE came from, for writing back to disk if the INODE 
is modified. The refCount field records the number of processes that are using 
the minode. The dirty field indicates whether the INODE has been modified while
in memory. The mounted flag indicates whether the INODE has been mounted on and,
if so, the mntabPtr points to the mount table entry of the mounted file system.
The lock field is to ensure that an in-memory INODE can only be accessed by one
process at a time, e.g. when modifying the INODE or accessing its data blocks in
a read/write operation.

(5) is a table of mounted file systems. Each entry contains the file system's
device name, device number and a pointer to in-memory INODE of the mount point.
For convenience and efficiency, some other information of the mounted file 
system, such as the superblock, group descriptor and bitmaps, may also be kept 
in the mount table entry for quick reference.


3. Implementation
 
   The implementation of the file system is divided into three levels. Each
level deals with a distinct part of the file system that can be implemented and
tested almost independently. This helps make the development process modular and
easier to understand.

Level-1 deals with traversing the file system tree. It contains the following
files, which implement the indicated functions.

   -------------------- Level-1 of FS ----------------------------
   mkdir_creat.c      : make directory and create file
   rmdir.c            : remove directory
   cd_pwd_stat.c      : change directory, get CWD path and file stat info
   link_unlink.c      : hard link and unlink files
   symlink_readlink.c : symbolic link files
   misc1.c            : access, chmod, chown, touch, etc.
  -----------------------------------------------------------------

   User level programs that make use of level-1 functions include
        mkdir, creat, rmdir, link, unlink, symlink, rm, ls, cd and pwd,
which can be used to test the level-1 implementation.


Level-2 deals with file contents. It contains the following files, which
implement the functions for reading/writing file contents.
   ---------------------- Level-2 of FS -------------------------------
   open_close_lseek.c  : open file for READ|WRITE|APPEND, close file and lseek
   read.c              : read from an opened file descriptor
   write.c             : write to an opened file descriptor 
   opendir_readdir.c   : read/write directory 
   dev_switch_table    : read/write special files
   block device I/O buffer management : I/O buffer management



Level-3 implements mount and umount operations and file protection.
   ---------------------- Level-3 of FS ------------------------------
   mount_umount.c      : mount/umount file systems
   file protection     : access permission checking
   file-locking        : lock/unlock files
   ------------------------------------------------------------------


4. Read/write Special Files:

  In the read()/write() algorithms, reading/writing pipes and special files are
treated differently. Reading/writing pipes are implemented in the pipe mechanism
in the MTX kernel. Here we only consider reading/writing special files. Each
special file has a file name in the /dev directory. The file type in a special
file's inode is marked as special, e.g. 0060000 = block device, 0020000 = char 
device, etc. Since a special file does not have any disk block, INODE.i_block[0]
is used to store the device's (major, minor) number, where major=device type and
minor=unit of that device type. For example, /dev/fd0=(2,0), /dev/tty0=(4,0) and
/dev/ttyS1=(5,1), etc. The major device number is an index in a device switch 
table, dev_sw[ ], which contains pointers to device driver functions, as in

         struct dev_sw {
             int (*dev_read)();
             int (*dev_write)();
         } dev_sw[];

Assume that int nocall(){ } is just an empty function, and

         fd_read(), fd_write(),           // floppy disk read/write
         hd_read(), hd_write(),           // hard disk read/write
         console_read(), console_write(), // console read/write
         serial_read(), serial_write(),   // serail port read/write 
         printer_write();                 // printer write()

are device driver functions. The device switch table is set up to contain the
driver function pointers, as shown below.

         struct dev_sw dev_sw[ ] =
         { //   read           write  
           // --------        --------
              nocall,          nocall,           // 0 /dev/null
              nocall,          nocall,           // 1 kernel memory
              fd_read,         fd_write,         // 2 FD
              hd_read,         hd_write,         // 3 HD
              console_read,    console_write,    // 4 console
              serial_read,     serial_write,     // 5 serial ports
              nocall,          printer_write     // 6 printer
         };

Then, reading/writing a special file becomes

      (1). get special file's (major, minor) number from INODE.i_block[0];
      (2). return (*dev_sw[major].dev_read)(minor, parameters);  // for READ
      OR   return (*dev_sw[major].dev_write)(minor, parameters); // for WRITE
      
(2). invokes the corresponding device driver function, passing as parameters
the minor device number and other parameters as needed. The device switch table
is a standard technique used in all Unix-like systems. It makes the I/O
subsystem structure clear and it greatly reduces the read/write code size.
Hopefully, this also answers an age-old question from many curious students,
namely why is the device number of floppy drives 2 and that of hard drives 3, 
etc. It's because the original Unix designers set up their device switch table 
this way, and everyone else has been a copycat ever since.  

5. open_dir()/readdir(): 

    Unix/Linux considers everything as a file. Therefore, we should be able to 
open a DIR for read just like a regular file. So technically there is no need
for a separate set of opendir() and readdir() functions. Since different Unix
systems may use different file systems, it may be difficult for a user to 
interpret the contents of a DIR file. For this reason, the POSIX standard 
specifies opendir()/readdir() operations, which should be independent of file 
systems. Support for opendir() is trivial. It's the same open syscall. However,
readdir() has the form
          struct dirent *ep = readdir(DIR *dp);
which returns a pointer to a dirent struct on each call. This calls for a user-
level implementation similar to a library I/O function. Since MTX does not have
user-leverl library stream I/O, we shall implement opendir() and readir() as
syscalls:
    
   int opendir(pathaname)
   {
       return open(pathname, O_RDONLY|O_DIR);
   }

where O_DIR is a bit pattern for openning the file as a DIR. In the open file
table, the mode field contains the O_DIR bit.

   int readdir(int fd, struct udir *dp) // struct udir{ DIR; name[256]};
   {
       // same as read() in kernel except:
       use the current byte offset in OFT to read the next DIR record;
       copy the DIR record into *udir in Umode;
   }

User mode programs must use the readdir(fd, struct udir *dir) syscall instead
of the readdir(DP) call.
