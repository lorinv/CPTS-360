                            Mounting Diagram
 
mount()    /*  Usage: mount filesys mount_point OR mount */
{

1. Ask for filesys (a pathname) and mount_point (a pathname also).
   If mount with no parameters: display current mounted filesystems.

2. Check whether filesys is already mounted: 
   (you may store the name of mounted filesys in the MOUNT table entry). 
   If already mounted, reject;
   else: allocate a free MOUNT table entry (whose dev == 0 means FREE).

3. open filesys for RW; use its fd number as the new DEV;
   Check whether it's an EXT2 file system: if not, reject.

4. find the ino, and then the minode of mount_point:
    call  ino  = get_ino(&dev, pathname);  to get ino:
    call  mip  = iget(dev, ino);           to load its inode into memory;    

5. Check mount_point is a DIR.  
   Check mount_point is NOT busy (e.g. can't be someone's CWD)

6. Record new DEV in the MOUNT table entry;

   (For convenience, store the filesys name in the Mount table, and also
                     store its ninodes, nblocks, etc. for quick reference)

7. Mark mount_point's minode as being mounted on and let it point at the
   MOUNT table entry, which points back to the mount_point minode.

. return 0;

}
  

umount(char *filesys)
{

1. Search the MOUNT table to check filesys is indeed mounted.

2. Check whether any file is still active in the mounted filesys;
      e.g. someone's CWD or opened files are still there,
   if so, the mounted filesys is BUSY ==> cannot be umounted yet.
   HOW to check?      ANS: by checking all minode[].dev

3. Find the mount_point's inode (which should be in memory while it's mounted 
   on).  Reset it to "not mounted"; then 
         iput()   the minode.  (because it was iget()ed during mounting)

4. return(0);

}  
  

                  IMPLICATIONS of mount:

    While it is easy to implement mount and umount, there are implications.
With mount, you must modify the get_ino(&dev, pathname) function to support 
"cross mount points". Assume that a file system, newfs, has been mounted on 
the directory /a/b/c/.  When traversing a pathname, mount point crossing may
occur in both directions.
 
(3).1. Dwonward traversal: When traversing the pathname /a/b/c/x/y, once you 
reach the minode of /a/b/c, you should see that the minode has been mounted on 
(mounted flag=1). Instead of searching for x in the INODE of /a/b/c, you must

    .Follow the minode's mountTable pointer to locate the mount table entry.
    .From the newfs's dev number, iget() its root (ino=2) INODE into memory.
    .Then,continue to search for x/y under the root INODE of newfs.

(3).2. Upward traversal: Assume that you are at the directory /a/b/c/x/ and 
traversing upward, e.g. cd  ../../,  which will cross the mount point at /a/b/c.
When you reach the root INODE of the mounted file system, you should see that it
is a root directory (ino=2) but its dev number differs from that of the real 
root. Using its dev number, you can locate its mount table entry, which points 
to the mounted minode of /a/b/c/. Then, you switch to the minode of /a/b/c/ and 
continue the upward traversal. Thus, crossing mount point is like a monkey or 
squirrel hoping from one tree to another tree and then back.
