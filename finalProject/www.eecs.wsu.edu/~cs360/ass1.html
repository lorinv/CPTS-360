               CS360  HOMEWORK Assignment #1
                   DUE : Jan. 23, 2015

                      HOW TO SUBMIT: 
      scp filename YOURNAME@cs360.eecs.wsu.edu:public_html/ASS1

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                         INSTRUCTIONS: 
1. Copy and paste THIS page as a file.
2. Use a text editor to fill in the blanks below.
3. Submit YOUR edited file to YOUR account on a SERVER machine (WILL BE READY later).
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                      FOR UBUNTU Users:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. sudo passwd root
2. enter new password for the superuser (e.g. same as your sudo password)
   (ASSUME YOU HAVE changed password for the superuser OK)
3. su  (enter password of superuser you just changed to)
4. YOU WILL BE THE SUPERSUPER from here on; no more that sudo junk stuff!)
5. cd  (cd to the /root directory and working from there)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
6. Your TERMs may still belong to your user account. DO THESE:
   1. edit .bashrc file by adding
            su 
   2. when you open a TERM, it will ask you for root user password; enter it.
   3. in the /root directory, edit or create a .bashrc file containing
                                                PATH=$PATH:./
      every time you login as root user, your PATH will have ./ in it ==>
      no more that ./a.out junk stuff anymore.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


A binary executable file, a.out, consists of

           |header| Code | Data |<-BSS->|

where BSS (Block Symbol Start) is for uninitialized globals and static locals.

The Unix command    size a.out   shows the size of TEXT, DATA, BSS of a.out.

Use the following C program, t1.c, to generate t2.c, t3.c,.. t6.c as specified below. 
        //********** t1.c file ************
          int g;                              
          main()                              
          {                                   
             int a,b,c; 
             a = 1; b = 2; 
             c = a + b;
             printf("c=%d\n", c);
          }                                

t2.c: Change the global variable  g  to  int g=3;
t3.c  Change the global variable  g  to  int g[10000];
t4.c  Change the global variable  g  to  int g[10000] = {4};
t5.c  Change the local variables of main() to
                 int a,b,c, d[10000];
t6.c. Change the local variables of main() to
          static int a,b,c, d[10000];

(A). For each case, use cc -m32 t#.c to generate a.out. Then use ls -l a.out to
     get a.out size, and run size a.out to get its section sizes. Record the
     observed sizes in a table:

          Case  | a.out |  TEXT  |  DATA  |  BSS   |
        --------------------------------------------
          (1)   |       |        |        |        |
        --------------------------------------------  
          (2)
        --------------------------------------------
          (3)
        --------------------------------------------
          (4)
        --------------------------------------------
          (5)
        --------------------------------------------        
          (6)
        --------------------------------------------

                  ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS:

   1. Variables in C may be classified as

          globals ---|--- UNINITIALIZED  globals;
                     |---   INITIALIZED  globals;

          locals  ---|--- AUTOMATIC locals;
                     |--- STATIC    locals;
          

   In terms of the above classifications and the variables g, a, b, c, d,

      Which variables are in DATA? ______________________________________
      Which variables are in BSS ? ______________________________________

   2. In terms of the TEXT, DATA and BSS sections,
      Which sections are in a.out, which section is NOT in a.out?
      WHY?______________________________________________________

  (B). For each case, use   cc -static t.c   to generate a.out.
       Record the sizes again and compare them with the sizes in (A).
