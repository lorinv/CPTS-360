                        HOW TO link_symlink

1. link oldFileName newFileName
   creates a file newFileName which has the SAME inode (number) as that of
   oldFileName.


   Example: link     /a/b/c                      /x/y/z ==>
                     /a/b/   datablock           /x/y    data block
                 ------------------------        -------------------------
                .. .|ino rlen nlen c|...        ....|ino rlen nlen z| ....
                ------|-----------------        ------|------------------
                      |                               |
                    INODE <----------------------------

                i_links_count = 1  <== INCrement i_links_count to 2



(1). get the INODE of /a/b/c into memory: mip->minode[ ]
                                               INODE of /a/b/c
                                               dev,ino
                                               .......
(2). check /a/b/c is a REG or LNK file (link to DIR is NOT allowed).

(3). check /x/y  exists and is a DIR but 'z' does not yet exist in /x/y/

(4). Add an entry [ino rec_len name_len z] to the data block of /x/y/
     This creates /x/y/z, which has the SAME ino as that of /a/b/c

(NOTE: both /a/b/c and /x/y/z must be on the SAME device; 
       link cannot be across different devices).

(5). increment the i_links_count of INODE by 1

(6). write INODE back to disk      


2. symlink oldNAME  newNAME    e.g. symlink /a/b/c /x/y/z

   ASSUME: oldNAME has <= 60 chars, inlcuding the NULL byte.

(1). verify oldNAME exists (either a DIR or a FILE)
(2). creat a FILE /x/y/z
(3). change /x/y/z's type to LNK (0120000)=(1010.....)=0xA...
(4). write the string oldNAME into the i_block[ ], which has room for 60 chars.

(INODE has 24 unused bytes after i_block[]. So, up to 84 bytes for oldNAME) 

(5). write the INODE of /x/y/z back to disk.
  
3. readlink pathname: return the contents of a symLink file

(1). get INODE of pathname into a minode[ ].
(2). check INODE is a symbolic Link file.
(3). return its string contents in INODE.i_block[ ].
