<H1>CS360 NOTES #1 : Introduction to Unix</H1>

<Pre>

1. You MUST have a computer running Linux which supports programming in C.
   Check YOUR Linux installation by trying to run some C programs. 
   Example:

         /******* test.c file *******/
         #include &lt;stdio.h>   
         #include &lt;stdlib.h>
         main()
         {
            int i;
            for (i=0; i < 10; i++)
                printf("i = %d\n", i);
         }
    
    -------------- Under Linux: --------------------
    gcc test.c         
    a.out
    ------------------------------------------------

2. Install and Run the MTX Operating System

   ============= DEMO OS MTX of KCW ===============================
   MTX is a Unix-like OS designed and written entirely by KCW. MTX can run on 
   either REAL PCs or Virtual Machines. Get MTX at

       http://www.eecs.wsu.edu/~cs360/samples/MTXinstallCD.iso
   
(1). Burn MTXinstallCD.iso to a CD/DVD or use it as a virtual CD.

(2). Under Linux, install QEMU on your Linux machine:
      ------------------------------------------
      mount -o loop MTXinstallCD.iso /mnt
      cp /mnt/vdisk ./
      cp /mnt/qemu-0.9.1-i386.tar.gz /
      umount /mnt

      cd /
      zcat qemu-0.9.1-i386.tar.gz | tar xvf -
      ------------------------------------------

(3).Run QEMU on vdisk:

      qemu -hda vdisk -smp 8 -m 512m -serial mon:stdio

     Then boot up MTX from partitions 
          1 (rmtx): MTX in 16-bit real mode
          2 (pmtx): MTX in 32-bit protected mode
          3 (smp) : SMP MTX in 32-bit protected mode
          4 (mtx32.1): MTX in 32-bit mode using segmentation

(4). When MTX starts, login as root
          login: root
          password: 12345

(5). Enter commands for sh to execute, just like in Unix/Linux


3. The Unix File System Tree:
   The Unix file system is organized as a tree, as shown below.


            |--> bin 
            |--> dev
            |--> etc
     / ---> |--> lib
            |--> sbin
            |              |--> bin
            |--> tmp       |--> include --> .h files 
            |              |--> lib
            |--> usr ----->|--> local
            |              |--> man
            |--> user      |--> X11 ------>
            |--> vmunix 


   Each NODE of the tree is a FILE. Unix files have the following types:

4. Unix File Types:

   (1). Directory files : 
        These are directories. A directory may contain other directories 
        and (non-directory) files.

   (2). Non-directory files : 
        Non-directory files are either REGULAR or SPECIAL files (SEE BELOW).
        Note that Non-directory files can only appear as leaf-nodes in the 
        tree.

        (2).1  REGULAR files : 
               Regular files are also called ORDINARY files. They contain 
               either ordinary text or executable binary codes.

        (2).2  SPECIAL files : 
               Special files are entries in the /dev directory. They represent
               I/O devices, and are further classified as . 

               CHAR  special files, e.g. /dev/tty0, /dev/modem.
               BLOCK special files, e.g. /dev/fd0,  /dev/hda.
               Other types such as Network special files.

   (3). Soft LINK files:
        These are Regular files whose contents are pathnames of other 
        files. As such they are used to reference other files.
        Example: the Unix command
                 ln   -s   aVeryLongFileName   myLink
        sets up  myLink  as a soft-link to  aVeryLongFileName.  Access to 
        myLink will be re-directed to the actual file aVeryLongFileName.

5. Pathname:

   The ROOT node of a Unix file system tree, symbolized by /, is called the 
   "root directory".

   Each node of the tree is represented by a PATHNAME of the form

             /a/b/c/d    OR    a/b/c/d

   So, each Unix file is specified by a pathname.

*   A pathname is ABSOLUTE if it begins with a /.  
*   A pathname is RELATIVE if it does not begin with a /. 
 
    A relative pathname starts from the Current Working Directory (CWD).
    When a user login to Unix, the CWD is usually set to his/hers HOME 
    directory.  The CWD can be changed by using the cd  command.  
    The pwd command prints the absolute pathname of the CWD.
            
6. Contents of Directories Under / :  

   /bin : commonly used system commands, e.g ls, date,...
   /dev : Special files.
   /etc : Unix system maintenance files.
   /lib : Unix system libraries.
   /sbin: Unix system administration commands.
   /tmp : temporary files.
   /usr : /usr/bin:      more executable files such as  cc,  gzip.
          /usr/include : .h files
          /usr/lib:      specific library files.
          /usr/man     : on-line manual directory.
          /usr/X11     : X-Window system.

   /user: user home directories.
   /vmunix : bootable Unix system image file.


7. Login:

(1). User Account:
     Each user is assigned an account by the system administrator. In a stand-
     alone Unix system, user accounts are maintained in a file named     
                        /etc/passwd.
     In a network system composed of many Unix machines, such information is 
     usually maintained on a Server machine, which provides other Unix machines
     with a single copy of the user account information. 
 
     A user account typically contains the following fields, separated by :

     root:aXuoPkB4hz:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
     kwang:Pir2NYB4Bqi9I:501:100:k.c.wang,cs faculty:/home/kwang:/bin/bash
     ----- ----------------- --- ------------------- ----------- --------------
  username: password :gid:uid:    full name      : HOME dir  : programToExecute

(2). Login Process:
     
     A PROCESS is a sequence of executions regarded as a single entiry by the 
     system. In Unix, every activity is carried out by a process.  
     When Unix starts, it generates a special process, P1, which executes the 
     file   /etc/init.  For this reason, P1 is also called the INIT process. 
     It is the parent of all user processes in the following manner:

     P1 reads some system configuration files to find out the terminals 
     supported by the system.  For each terminal, it generates a child process 
     on that terminal. Then, it waits for any of the terminal process to 
     terminate.  When a terminal process terminates (by user logout), P1 
     regenerates another child process on that terminal. 

     Each child process opens 3 (stream) FILEs on its own terminal. These FILEs
     are known as 

          stdin : the terminal's Keyboard, for inputs;
          stdout: the terminal's Display, for outputs;
          stderr: also the Display, for error outputs;

     Then the child process executes /etc/getty, which displays the message  
          login:  
     on its stdout, awaiting a user to login.  
     At this moment, the login process is not yet associated with any user.

     When a user tries to login, the login process validates his/her username 
     and password in /etc/passwd. If the user has a valid account, the login 
     process takes on the user's uid and gid, thereby becoming the user's 
     process.  It then sets the CWD to the user's HOME directory and executes 
     the program specified in the user's account. That program is usually a 
     version of the Unix shell, e.g. bash, csh, etc.
    
     The Unix shell is a command interpreter.  It displays a prompt
         %     (OR some other symbol, which can be set by the usr)
     and waits for the user to input commands.

     A command is simply an executable program. When the user enters a command,
     the sh process (i.e. the user process that's executing the sh) will

       (1). generate a child process to perform the command;
       (2). wait for the child process to terminate;
       (3). prompt the user for commands again;  
            The sh process terminates when it sees logout or END_OF_FILE.
   
     NOTE that the command is NOT executed by sh itself but by a child process.

     Using this feature of sh, a user can start many processes, each performing
     a different task.  For example, the command (line)

            %   ls & date & a.out  &
                --   ----   ----- ----- 
                C1    C2     C3   NoWait

     will start 3 children processes, C1, C2, C3, which execute ls, date, a.out
     respectively, and cause the sh to prompt again without waiting for any of
     the child processes to terminate.  This is called MULTI-TASKING.

     In this example, all 4 processes will run CONCURRENTLY (which means IN 
     PARALLEL in a logical sense). Among them, the sh runs in the FOREGROUND 
     while others run in the BACKGROUND.  Only the foreground process can 
     receive inputs from stdin.
     The  fg  command can be used to raise a background process to foreground.
     The  ps  command displays all the ProcessId (PID) of a user.


8. REVIEW QUESTIONS:

(1). The   ls -l   command lists the contents of a directory:

drwxr-xr-x   root   bin     2048  Dec 23 09:22 bin/
lrwxrwxrwx   root   root      23  Dec 20 20:15 kwang -> /home/kwang/public_html
-rw-r--r--   root   root  433387  Dec  8 21:52 vmlinuz
-rwxr-xr-x   kwang  kwang  21400  Jan 10 07{30 a.out

EXPLAIN THE MEANING OF EACH field?

(2). What are the permission bits of a file, and what do they do?
     
(3). Each user has a UserId (uid) and a GroupId (gid).  
     How does a user get hid/her uid and gid?
     What are the uid and gid used for? 

(4). The owner of a file can use the Unix command
         chmod  0766  fileName  
     to change the mode of fileName. What are the resulting permissions?

(5). What does the x bits of a directory mean?

(6). Unix has a special user, called the SuperUser or the Root, who can access
     any file. What's the reason for having such a Super user?

(7). How does a user acquire a Unix process?

(8). How many processes will be executing with the sh command?
         %  a & b & c & d &
     Which one is the foreground process?

(9). The Unix command    ls | more
     sets up 2 processes, one executes ls and the other executes more, in such 
     a way that the outputs of the first process ls are PIPEd to the second 
     process more. 
     How many processes will be executing with the sh command?
         %  a | b | c | d
