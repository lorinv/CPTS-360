                   CS360 NOTES on FILE OPERATIONS

1. File Operations in Unix consists of 5 levels, from LOW to HIGH:
   
1.1. Hardware Level:
     File operations at this level prepare the hardware device, such as disk 
     drives, for storing file systems.

     Examples: fdisk : divide a hard disk into partitions.
               mkfs  : create a file system on a disk, also known as format.
               fsck  : check and repair file systems.
               defragementation: compact file system.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Example 1: Under Linux, run    
                 fdisk /dev/hda OR fdisk /dev/sda 
          enter  p   # to see partitions on YOUR hard disk
          enter  q   # to quit fdisk

Example 2: Run   cat > mydisk
           enter CONTROL_D to end cat
                 mkfs mydisk 1440
                 mount -o loop mydisk /mnt
                 mount; ls /mnt;
                 mkdir /mnt/hi; ls /mnt
                 umount /mnt
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

1.2. System Call Level:
     Every Operating System provides support for BASIC file operations. 
     Some of these functions in the Unix kernel are listed below:

          kmount(), kumount();            (for mount/umount file systems)

          Kmkdir(), Krmdir(), Kchdir()    (obvious)  
          kgetcwd(char *buf[], int size)   copy CWD pathname into buf[ ]

          klink(),  kunlink(),ksymlink(), (for link/remove files) 
          Kchmod(), Kchown(), ktouch()    (change file MODE, owner, time)  

          Kcreat(), Kopen(),              (create/open file for R,W,RW,..) 
          Kread(),  Kwrite(),             (read/write opened files) 
          Klseek();                       (change R/W byte position)
          Kclose()                        (close opened files)

          kopendir(), kreaddir(), kclosedir(), (READ directories)
          kreadlink();                    (READ symbolic link files)

          kstat(),  kfstat(), klstat(),   (get file status/information)

     The prefix K emphasizes that these are functions inside the Unix Kernel.

     
                        SYSTEM CALLS:

     Processes use System Calls (syscall for short) to access Kernel functions.

Example 1: man 2  mkdir, rmdir, chdir, getcwd, unlink

#include &lt;stdio.h>
#include &lt;unistd.h>

char buf[1024], *s;

main()
{
  int r;
  r = mkdir("dir1", 0755);  // mkdir("name", mode)
  printf("r=%d\n", r);

  r = chdir("dir1");
  printf("r=%d\n", r);

  s = getcwd(buf, 64);
  printf("cwd=%s\n", s);

 // use rmdir to remove a DIR
 // use unlink to remove a file, etc.  
}
           
Example 2:

#include &lt;fcntl.h>  
#define BLKSIZE 1024
int fd; char buffer[BLKSIZE];
main()
{
   fd = open("mydisk", O_RDONLY);   /* open a disk image for READ */
   read(fd, buffer, BLKSIZE);       /* read block#0 into buffer */
   lseek(fd, (long)(2*BLKSIZE), 0); /* skip 2048 bytes ==> to BLOCK#3 */
   read(fd, buffer, BLKSIZE);       /* read one block into buffer */
}

The functions open(), read(), write(), lseek(), close() in a User mode 
program are Library functions.  Each such Library function issues a
syscall, causing the process to switch from User mode to Kernel mode.
Once in K mode, the process will be directed to the corresponding Kenrel
function, e.g. open() goes to Kopen(), read() goes to Kread(), etc.  
When the process finishes executing the Kernel function, it returns to 
User mode with the desired results (or returns -1 if error).

Syscalls cause the process to enter K mode and then back to U mode.
Switching between Umode and Kmode takes a lot of actions (and time). Data
transfer between Kmode and Umode is especially "expensive". 
Although it is permissible to issue
               read(fd, buffer, 1);
syscall to read just ONE byte, it is NOT very wise to do so because that 
one byte would come with a terrific cost. Every time you have to cross the
boarder to enter the wonderful world of Kernel, do as much as you can 
rather than in piece meal in order to make the journey worthwhile. In the
case of READ/WRITE files, the best way is to match what the Kernel does. 
The kernel reads/writes disks by BLOCK size, which ranges from 1KB to
8KB. For instance, in Linux, the default BLOCK size is 4KB for hard disks
and 1KB for floppy disks. 

1.3  Library I/O Functions:
    
     Syscalls allow us to read/write chunks of data, which are just a sequence
     of bytes. They do not know, nor care, about the meaning of the data. 
     However, a user (program) often needs to read/write individual chars or
     lines. If so, the user program would have to do these from/to a beffered 
     data area by itself. Most users would consider this "too much"!

     The C library provides a set of standard I/O functions for convenience, 
     as well as for run-time efficiency. The library I/O functions include:

     FILE I/O      :  fopen(), fread(); fwrite(), fseek(), fclose();
                      fflush(), 
     char mode I/O :  getc(), putc(), getchar(), putchar(), ungetc()
     line mode I/O :  gets(), puts(), fgets(), fputs();

     formatted I/O :  scanf(), fscanf(), sscanf();
                      printf(), fprintf(), sprintf()

     With the exceptions of sscanf()/sprintf(), which read/write memroy 
     locations, all other library I/O functions are built on top of syscalls 
     in that they ultimately issue syscalls for "actual" data transfer through
     the Operating System Kernel.

1.4. User Commands Level:

     Instead of writing programs, users may use Unix commands to manipulate
     files. Examples of user commands are

            mkdir, rmdir, cd, pwd, ls;
            rm, cat, cp, mv, chmod, .....

     Each user command is in fact an executable program (except cd), which 
     typically calls library I/O functions, which in turn issue syscalls to 
     invoke the corresponding kernel functions. Thus, the processing sequence 
     is either
            Command ==> Library I/O function ==> Syscall ==> | Kernel Function
        or
            Command ===========================> Syscall ==> | Kernel Function

1.5. sh Script Files:

     Although much more convenient than syscalls, commands must be entered
     manually, which is often tedious and time-consuming.

     sh scripts are files written in the sh programming language. The sh 
     language includes all valid Unix commands. It also includes additional 
     statements (if, do, for, while, case, etc.) to control the executions.  
     In practice, sh scripts are used extensively in Unix system programming.
     In addition to sh, many other script languages, such as Perl, are also in
     wide use. sh programming will be covered later.
