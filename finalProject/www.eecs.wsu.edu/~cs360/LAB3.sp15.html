     CS360 Lab Assignment #3 : File Operations across Networks
               
                     WORK IN 2-PERSON TEAMS
                   DUE & DENO : March 3,4; 2015

A. OBJECTIVES:
   Network Programming using TCP.
   Unix system calls for file operations.

B. TCP/IP Program:
   Per LAB4 Pre-work.

C. REQUIREMENTS:
   Modify the server/client programs in the pre-lab to do the following:

     Client : input a command:
              ----------------  
              pwd
              ls   [pathname]
              cd    pathname
              mkdir pathname
              rmdir pathname       
              rm    pathname       (rm pathname)
              get   pathname       (cp pathname to client side)
              put   pathname       (cp pathanme to server side)
              quit                 (Client exits)
           -----------------
           send command to Server.
           receive reply AND results from Server. Display the results

     Also,implement the (local) commands
         lcat lpwd, lls, lcd, lmkdir. lrmdir, lrm
     which the Client executes LOCALLY.

     Server:
             get a command from Client;
             perform the command;
             send reply to Client;

C. HELP Hints:

(1). Make each command a fixed-length string, e.g. of MAX=256 bytes.
     REASON: a TCP socket contains a "stream" of data. Each read operation
             reads whatever is available in the socket. Using fixed-length 
             items simplifies reading individual command strings.

(2). Assume get filname:

            CLIENT                             SERVER
   -------------------------------    -------------------------------
  send request (get filename)  ====>  stat filename to get type AND SIZE  
  wait for reply               <===   send SIZE=xxxx or BAD 
  if (BAD): next input;               if (BAD): next command
  ====================================================================
  count = 0;                         
  open filename for WRITE             open filename for READ
  while(count < SIZE){                while(n=read(fd, buf, MAX)){
     n = read(socket,buf,MAX); <=====   send n bytes from buf
     count += n;
     write n bytes to file;
  }                                   }      
  close file;                         close file;

(3). You figure out the algorithm for put filname
