                 HOW TO USE THE GDB DEBUGGER

GDB is an interactive debugger which can debug programs written in C, C++ and
many other languages. Under Linux or Unix, use  man gdb  to read the manual
pages of gdb. This note shows how to use gdb in conjunction with emacs under
X-window.

1. Under X-window, use emacs to edit a C file, e.g. t.c
   
   int a,b,c;
   main()
   {
      printf("enter main\n");
      a = 1;
      b = 2;
      printf("calling sub\n");
      c = sub(a,b);
      printf("back from sub: c = %d\n", c);
   }

   int sub(int x, int y)
   {
      int u, v;
      printf("enter sub\n");
      u = 4; 
      v = 5;
      printf("return from sub\n");
      return (x+y+u+v);
   }

2. Under emacs's Tools menu, select  Compile ==> modify the command line at 
   the bottom to
                 cc -g t.c

   the -g flag tells cc to generate a.out for debugging (it builds a symbol 
   table for debugger to access variables and functions in the C program). 
   Without -g, a.out cannot be debugged by gdb.

   Emacs will show the compile results in a split window.

3. Under the File menu, 
        choose Remove Splits    to kill the split window.
   Then choose Split Window     to create a split window (containing t.c)

4. Under the Toosl menu, select Debugger ===> the bottom line will show 

         gdb a.out

   Enter to invoke gdb on a.out. gdb will run in the TOP window. Execution of 
   t.c will be displayed in the split window.

5. In the gdb window: enter gdb commands to
     ---------------------------------------------------
      set breakpoints:  b main; b sub; b 10; etc
      run a.out (with command line parameters as usual)
      print variable values
      set watchpoints (of variable changes)
      next line 
      continue execution
      step (single step execution)
      examine stack frames
      etc.
     ---------------------------------------------------

6. Sample sessions:
   Assume:  cc -g t.c ==> a.out
            gdb a.out ==> ----------------------------- 
                              GDB windows
                          -----------------------------
                              t.c source window
                          -----------------------------
(1). Set break points to main, sub (function names) ==> execution will stop
     whenever main() or sub() is reached.
     b main    ==> set break point at main()
     b sub     ==> another break point at sub()

(1.1). You may also set breakpoints to line numbers (as you scroll up or
       down in the C program window, emacs displays line numbers):
       b   200    (stop whenever at line 200 in t.c file)
       b   100    (stop at line 100, etc.)

(2). r         ==> run a.out ==> will stop immediately at main()
                   An arrow => will point at the line to be executed.
(3). n         ==> execute next line of t.c
     n         ==> another line, etc.

(4). p a       ==> print value of a 
     p b       ==> print value of b, etc.

(5). The printf() lines will generae outputs in the GDB window.
=================================================================
(6). c         ==> continue (continue execution normally).==>
                   will call sub()

(7). Since sub() is a break point, executionn will stop at sub()

(8). While in sub(), use 
     
     info local   to see values of all local variables of the function.
  
     **** Examine stack frames; not very useful for simple programs ***** 
     bt           (backtrce) to see stack frames up to the current function:
                  bt display each frame in one line with a FRAME# (0,1,2,etc).
     frame fFRAME# to display that stack frame
     **********************************************************************

(9). HOW TO CHNAGE variable values:
     set VAR a=100   ===> set variale a to 100
     set VAR b=200   ===> set b to 200, etc.
 
(10). HOW TO clear break points:
      clear line#   (Clear bp at line#)
      clear name    (clear bp at function name)

(11). Watch varaible changes:
      watch c    ( watch for changes in variable c; whenever c changes
                   it will display its old value and new value)
      watch u    ( watch changes in u, etc).
==============================================================================


7. Best Debugging:
   All debugging tools can only offer limited help. The BEST approach to
   program development is to write your source code carefully (so that it 
   would not need any debugging tool at all). Use printf or fprintf in a 
   program is often more effective than relying on a debugging tool.
    
    
8. HOW DOES A PROGRAM TERMINATE

   OS Kernel:              kexit(value):      ZOMBIE PROC
                              |         ---------------------- 
                              |         exitValue=| Hi  | Lo  |
                              |                   |value| SIG#|
                              |         -----------------------
==============================|=============================|==========
A. NORMAL TERMINATION:        ^                               
                              |                             
   a.out memory image:        |                             
     crt0.o                   |                             
      |         exit(0) --> _exit(0)                         
     main()       |                                          
     {            |
                  |
(1). } ======> to crt0.o


(2). In main()
     or any part of a.out
    
        exit(value)-----> _exit(value)

(3).   _exit(value) ----> to Kernel to DIE immediately.
----------------------------------------------------------

B. ABNORMAL TERMINATION:

(1). Exceptions:
     divide by zero      |
     illegal address     |
     illegal instruction |:ALL trap to Kernel ==> Signal Number in Lo byte 
     privilege violation |
     etc.                |       
    
(2). Signal from Other Process:

       kill -s (1 to 31) pid ==> send signal# to target process by pid
                                 requesting it to DIE.
