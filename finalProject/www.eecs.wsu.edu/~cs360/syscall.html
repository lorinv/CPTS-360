         360 Notes on System Calls for File Operations

1. What are syscalls?

   Syscall is a mechanism that allows a process to enter Kernel mode to 
   perform operations not allowed in User mode. Operations such as open files,
   read/write files, fork, exec, even termination, must all be done in Kernel.
   In this set of notes, we shall focus on Unix syscalls for file operations.
   
2. Where to find these information:

   Under Linux, the man pages of all syscalls are listed in /usr/man/man2/.
   The Unix command man 2 NAME displays the man pages of NAME in man2/. 
   Similarly, man 8 mkfs displays the man pages of mkfs in /usr/man/man8/. 

   DO: practice using man to read Linux's man pages.
 
3. How to use these functions?

   Include them in your C program, just like ordinary function calls. A return 
   value >=0 means OK, -1 means BAD. An implicitly defined global int variable,
   errno, records the error code.  Each error code number has a corresponding
   string description, as the following program shows.

            #include &lterrno.h&gt
            main()
            {
              if (mkdir("newdir", 0777) < 0){
                 printf("errno=%d : %s\n", errno, strerror(errno));
              }
            }

    If you run the program twice, the second time it will print
                   errno=17 : File exists
    as it should.
    ************************************************************** 
                         EXERCISES:
       Write a C program to test :  
               mkdir, rmdir, chdir, creat, unlink, rename, chmod
    **************************************************************

4. READ and LEARN how to use these syscalls on your own:

   access : check user's permissions for a file : R_OK,W_OK,X_OK,F_OK. 
            int access(const char *pathname, int mode);

   chdir  : change directory
            int chdir(const char *path);

   chmod  : change permissions of a file
            int chmod(const char *path, mode_t mode);

   OTHERS : chown, chroot, setuid


   mkdir  : create a directory
            int mkdir(const char *pathname, mode_t mode);

   rmdir  : remove a directory (must be empty)
            int rmdir(const char *pathname);

   link   : make a new name for a file
            int link(const char *oldpath, const char *newpath);


   unlink : delete a name and possibly the file it refers to
            int unlink(const char *pathname);

   symlink: create a symbolic link for a file
            int symlink(const char *oldpath, const char *newpath);

   rename : change the name of a file
            int rename(const char *oldpath, const char *newpath);
  
                       SPECIAL ONES:

   mount  : int  mount(const  char  *specialfile, const char * dir , 
                       const char *filesystemtype, unsigned long mountflags , 
                       const void * data);

   umount : int umount(const char *dir);

   mknod  : make special files, e.g.  mknod /dev/fd2 b 2 2


5. To be covered in details in class:

      open, creat, umask
      read, write, lseek
      close

      opendir : DIR *opendir(const char *name);
      readdir : int readdir(unsigned int fd, struct dirent *dirp, unsigned int count);
      readlink: int readlink(const char *path, char *buf, size_t bufsiz);

      stat :  int stat(const char *file_name, struct stat *buf);
              int fstat(int filedes, struct stat *buf);
              int lstat(const char *file_name, struct stat *buf);


6. The stat Systen Call

6-1. Link Files:
   In Unix, every file has a pathname, such as /a/b/c. However, Unix allows 
different pathnames to represent the same file. These are known as LINK files.
There are two kinds of LINKs, HARD link and SOFT link. 

HARD Links: 
     The command    ln  oldpath  newpath 

creates a HARD link from newpath to oldpath. The corresponding syscall is

          link(char *oldpath, char *newpath)

NOTE: Hard links can only be applied to non-DIR files. 
      (What would happen if DIRs could be hard linked ?) 

Hard linked files share the same inode, whose nlink field records the number of
hard links to the inode. Converse to link, the syscall
 
        unlink(char *pathname)

finds the inode of pathname and decrements its nlink by 1. The file is truly 
removed only if nlink becomes 0. This is what the rm command does.
    
SOFT Links:  
     The command   ln -s  oldpath newpath  

creates a SOFT or Symbolic link from newpath to oldpath. The corresponding
syscall is 
             symlink(char *oldpath, char *newpath)

The newpath is (almost a regular) file, which contains the oldpath string. It
acts like a detour road sign, which directs the traffic to the real destination
(oldpath). Unlike hard links, soft links can be applied to any file, such as

             ln -s   aVeryLongPathname                 a
             ln -s   aFileWhichMayBeChangedOften       b

One drawback of soft link is that the target file may NOT exist. If so, the
detour would direct the poor driver to fall off a cliff. In Linux, such death
traps are displayed in (the appropriate color of) RED under the ls -l command.

Also, if foo -> /a/b/c is a soft link file, the open("foo", 0) syscall, as 
implemented, will open the target file /a/b/c, not the link file foo itself. 
So, the open()/read() syscalls would NOT read any soft link file. Instead, the
syscall, readlink(), must be used to read the contents of a soft link file. 

 
A Brief Summary about Links:
           Command                               Syscall used
  =======================================================================
    ln     oldpath newpath             link(char *oldpath, char *newpath)
    ln -s  oldpath newpath          symlink(char *oldpath, char *newpath)
  =======================================================================

6-2. File Status:
   Every file has a UNIQUE inode, whcih contain ALL the information about the
file. The syscalls, stat/lstat/fstat, return the info of a file. 

9-2-1. INODE:
     Every file is represented by a unique INODE data strucutre, which is shown
here for reference.:

struct ext2_inode {
  unsigned short i_mode;
  unsigned short i_uid;
  unsigned long  i_size;
  unsigned long  i_atime;
  unsigned long  i_ctime;
  unsigned long  i_mtime;
  unsigned long  i_dtime;
  unsigned short i_gid;
  unsigned short i_links_count;
  unsigned long  i_blocks;
  unsigned long  i_flags;
  unsigned long  i_reserved1;
  unsigned long  i_block[15];
  // several other unimportant fields
};

6-2.2  The man pages of stat:
    Use  man stat  to read the man pages of the stat system call, which is 
shown below.
=============================================================================
STAT(2)                    System calls                   STAT(2)

NAME
       stat, fstat, lstat - get file status

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
       #include &lt;sys/stat.h&gt;
       #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;

       int stat(const char *file_name, struct stat *buf);
       int fstat(int filedes, struct stat *buf);
       int lstat(const char *file_name, struct stat *buf);

DESCRIPTION
       These  functions  return  information  about the specified
       file.  You do not need any access rights to  the  file  to
       get  this  information  but  you need search rights to all
       directories named in the path leading to the file.

       stat stats the file pointed to by file_name and  fills  in
       buf.

       lstat  is  identical to stat, except in the case of a sym-
       bolic link, where the link itself is stat-ed, not the file
       that it refers to.

       fstat  is identical to stat, only the open file pointed to
       by filedes (as returned by open(2)) is stated in place  of
       file_name.


       They  all return a stat structure, which contains the fol-
       lowing fields:

            struct stat {
                dev_t         st_dev;      /* device */
                ino_t         st_ino;      /* inode */
                mode_t        st_mode;     /* protection */
                nlink_t       st_nlink;    /* number of hard links */
                uid_t         st_uid;      /* user ID of owner */
                gid_t         st_gid;      /* group ID of owner */
                dev_t         st_rdev;     /* device type (if inode device) */
                off_t         st_size;     /* total size, in bytes */
                unsigned long st_blksize;  /* blocksize for filesystem I/O */
                unsigned long st_blocks;   /* number of blocks allocated */
                time_t        st_atime;    /* time of last access */
                time_t        st_mtime;    /* time of last modification */
                time_t        st_ctime;    /* time of last change */
            };

       The value st_size gives the size of the file (if it  is  a
       regular file or a symlink) in bytes. The size of a symlink
       is the length of the pathname it contains, without  trail-
       ing NULL.

       The value st_blocks gives the size of the file in 512-byte
       blocks.  (This may be smaller than st_size/512  e.g.  when
       the file has holes.)  The value st_blksize gives the "pre-
       ferred" blocksize for efficient file system I/O.  (Writing
       to a file in smaller chunks may cause an inefficient read-
       modify-rewrite.)

       Not all of the Linux filesystems implement all of the time
       fields.   Some  file system types allow mounting in such a
       way that file accesses do  not  cause  an  update  of  the
       st_atime field. (See `noatime' in mount(8).)

       The  field  st_atime  is changed by file accesses, e.g. by
       exec(2), mknod(2), pipe(2), utime(2) and read(2) (of  more
       than zero bytes). Other routines, like mmap(2), may or may
       not update st_atime.

       The field st_mtime is changed by file modifications,  e.g.
       by  mknod(2),  truncate(2), utime(2) and write(2) (of more
       than zero bytes).  Moreover, st_mtime of  a  directory  is
       changed  by  the  creation  or  deletion  of files in that
       directory.  The st_mtime field is not changed for  changes
       in owner, group, hard link count, or mode.

       The  field  st_ctime  is  changed by writing or by setting
       inode information (i.e., owner, group, link  count,  mode,
       etc.).

       The  following  POSIX macros are defined to check the file
       type:

              S_ISREG(m)  is it a regular file?

              S_ISDIR(m)  directory?

              S_ISCHR(m)  character device?

              S_ISBLK(m)  block device?

              S_ISFIFO(m) fifo?

              S_ISLNK(m)  symbolic link? (Not in POSIX.1-1996.)

              S_ISSOCK(m) socket? (Not in POSIX.1-1996.)

       The following flags are defined for the st_mode field:

       S_IFMT     0170000   bitmask for the file type bitfields
       S_IFSOCK   0140000   socket
       S_IFLNK    0120000   symbolic link
       S_IFREG    0100000   regular file
       S_IFBLK    0060000   block device
       S_IFDIR    0040000   directory
       S_IFCHR    0020000   character device
       S_IFIFO    0010000   fifo

       S_ISUID    0004000   set UID bit
       S_ISGID    0002000   set GID bit (see below)
       S_ISVTX    0001000   sticky bit (see below)

       S_IRWXU    00700     mask for file owner permissions
       S_IRUSR    00400     owner has read permission
       S_IWUSR    00200     owner has write permission
       S_IXUSR    00100     owner has execute permission
       S_IRWXG    00070     mask for group permissions
       S_IRGRP    00040     group has read permission
       S_IWGRP    00020     group has write permission
       S_IXGRP    00010     group has execute permission
       S_IRWXO    00007     mask for permissions for others (not in group)
       S_IROTH    00004     others have read permission
       S_IWOTH    00002     others have write permisson
       S_IXOTH    00001     others have execute permission

RETURN VALUE
       On success, zero is returned.  On error, -1  is  returned,
       and errno is set appropriately.

=============================================================================

6-2.3 File Type and Permissions:
    Among the fileds of the stat structure, only the st_mode field needs
    some explanation:

       mode_t        st_mode;     /* copied from i_mode of INODE */

    The TYPE of st_mode is unsigned short (2 bytes or 16 bits). 
    The 16 bits have the following meaning:

       |Type|   |permissions|
       ----------------------
       |tttt|fff|uuu|ggg|ooo| 
       ----------------------

    The leading 4 bits are file types, which can be interpreted as (Octals)

       S_IFMT     0170000   bitmask for the file type bitfields
       S_IFSOCK   0140000   socket
       S_IFLNK    0120000   symbolic link
       S_IFREG    0100000   regular file
       S_IFBLK    0060000   block device
       S_IFDIR    0040000   directory
       S_IFCHR    0020000   character device
       S_IFIFO    0010000   fifo
 
    The next 3 bits are flags, which indicate special usage of the file 

       S_ISUID    0004000   set UID bit
       S_ISGID    0002000   set GID bit 
       S_ISVTX    0001000   sticky bit 

    The remaining 9 bits are PERMISSION bits for file protection:

        owner  group  other
         rwx    rwx    rwx
    
    By interpreting these bits, YOU may disaplay the st_mode field as
       -rwxr-xr-x             (REG file) 
       drwxr-xr-x             (DIR)
       lrw-r--r--             (LNK file)

==============================================================================
6-3. HOW TO read DIR Entries:
   Read the man pages of   
            opendir, readdir, readlink  
to learn how to use these syscalls to open a DIR file for read, and then read 
the contents of a DIR file (as DIR entry strings). Alos, learn how to read the
contents of a (soft) LNK file itself.
