            NOTES #11: EXT2 File System on Virtual FD

Under Linux, run the following commands:

      touch mydisk          # create a file named mydisk
      mke2fs mydisk 1440    # format mydisk as an EXT2 FS

mke2fs creates an EXT2 file system on mydisk with 1440 blocks of 1KB block size.
It is essentially a 1.44MB FLOPPY disk image. The mkfs program reports some 
statistics, such as block size=1024,184 inodes, 1440 blocks, etc. 
It also creates a default lost+found directory. You may use the commands  
      mount -o loop mydisk /mnt;  rm -r /mnt/*;   umount /mnt
to make the file system empty.

Alternatively, you may download ~samples/kcwmkfs and run it as
      kcwmkfs mydisk 1440 [ninodes]
which creates an (empty) EXT2 FS on mydisk containing only the / directory.
 
 
The layout of an EXT2 file system on a virtual disk image is 

 1KB      0    1    2    3    4  | 5 . ........... 27| 28 ..................|

NOTE: Depending on mkfs: Bmap, Imap, Inodes and data start blocks MAY vary.

The block contents are explained below.

Block#0: Boot Block:
  B0 is the boot block, which is not used by the file system.

Block#1: Super Block: (At byte offset 1024 in hard disk partitions)
  B1 is the Superblock, which is described by the super_block structure, where 
  only the essential fields are explained. You may ignore the other fields.

typedef __u16   u16;           // unsigned short
typedef __u32   u32;           // unsigned long

	u32	s_first_ino; 		// First non-reserved inode 
====>	u16     s_inode_size; 		// size of inode structure 

  // some MORE non-essential fileds
};

Block#2: Group Descriptor Block (in s_first_data_block+1 on hard disk)
EXT2 divides disk blocks into GROUPs. Each group contains 8192 (contiguous)
blocks. Each group is described by a group_desc structure of 32 bytes:

struct ext2_group_desc
{
  u32  bg_block_bitmap;          // Bmap block number
  u32  bg_inode_bitmap;          // Imap block number
  u32  bg_inode_table;           // Inodes begin block number
  u16  bg_free_blocks_count;     // THESE are OBVIOUS
  u16  bg_free_inodes_count;
  u16  bg_used_dirs_count;        

  u16  bg_pad;                   // ignore these 
  u32  bg_reserved[3];
};

Since a FD has only 1440 blocks, B2 contains only 1 group_desc structure (The
rest are 0's).

Block#3: Block Bitmap (Bmap):
A bitmap is a sequence of bits used to represent some kind of items, e.g. disk
blocks or inode structures. Bitmaps are used to allocate/deallocate items. In a
bitmap, a 0 bit means the corresponding item is FREE, and a 1 bit means the 
corresponding item is in USE. A FD has 1440 blocks but block#0 is NOT used by
the file system. So, the Bmap has only 1439 valid bits in B3. The exact values 
of Bmap will be shown later.

Block#4: Inode Bitmap (Imap)
An inode is a data structure used to represent a file. A file system is created
with a finite number of inodes. The status of the inodes are represented by a
a bitmap, called the Imap, in B4. 
In an EXT2 FS, the first 10 inodes are reserved. Thus, the Imap of an empty FS
starts with TEN 1's, followed by 0's. The Imap has only ninodes VALID bits.
Invalid bits are set to 1, indicating that they are NOT available.

Block#5: Inodes (begin) Block
In Unix, every file is represented by a UNIQUE inode structure of 128 bytes
(256 bytes in EXT4), defined as follows.

struct ext2_inode {
  //*************************************************************************
  u16  i_mode;          // same as st_mode in stat() syscall
  u16  i_uid;                     // ownerID
  u32  i_size;                    // file size in bytes
  u32  i_atime;                   // time fields  
  u32  i_ctime;
  u32  i_mtime;
  u32  i_dtime;
  u16  i_gid;                     // groupID
  u16  i_links_count;             // link count
  u32  i_blocks;                  // IGNORE
  u32  i_flags;                   // IGNORE
  u32  i_reserved1;               // IGNORE
  u32  i_block[15];               // See details below
  //**************************************************************************

  // IGNORE THE FOLLOWING FIELDS
  u32  i_version;
  u32  i_file_acl;
  u32  i_dir_acl;
  u32  i_faddr;
  u8   i_frag;
  u8   i_fsize;
  u16  i_pad1;
  u32  i_reserved2[2];
}

The fields i_block[15] record the disk blocks (numbers) of a file, which are 

    DIRECT blocks : i_block[0] to i_block[11], which point to direct blocks.
    INDIRECT block: I_block[12] points to a block, which contians 256 (ulong) 
                    block numbers.
    DOUBLE INDIRECT block: 
                    I_block[13] points to a block, which points to 256 blocks,
                    each of which point to 256 blocks.
    TRIPLE INDIRECT block: 
                    I_block[14] points to a block, which points to 256 blocks,
                    each of which points to 256 blocks, each of which points to
                    256 blocks.
    
The total number of inodes is always a multiple of 8. Every disk block contains
an integral number of inodes, so that no inode is split between blcoks. The 
number of inode blocks is therefore
                    (total number of inodes)/8. 
For example, if the number of inodes is 184, which needs 184/8=23 blocks,
then the inode blocks include B5, B6, ......., B27.

Each inode is determined uniquely by its POSITION (counting from 0,1,2,...) in
the inode area. The position PLUS 1 is called the inode number (i_number or 
ino for short), which counts from 1. (A 0 i_number means no inode). In an EXT2
FS, the first 10 inodes are reserved. The root inode is inode #2.

Data Blocks:
Immediately after the inode blocks are the data blocks. In the example of 184
inodes, the first real data block is B28, which is i_block[0] of the root
directory /.

EXT2 Directory Entries:
A directory contains dir_entry sturctures. In EXT2, component file names can 
vary form 1 to 255 chars long. So the dir_entries also have varying length. 

struct ext2_dir_entry_2 {
	u32  inode;        // Inode number; count from 1, NOT from 0
	u16  rec_len;      // This entry length in bytes
	u8   name_len;     // Name length in bytes
	u8   file_type;    // for future use
	char name[EXT2_NAME_LEN];  // File name: 1-255 chars, no NULL byte
};

************************ Mailman's Algorithm by KCW *************************

 A (well-planned) city has M blocks, numbered 0,1,2,..,M-1. Each block has N 
 houses, numbered 0,1,..,N-1. Each house has a unique BLOCK address in the form
                BA = (BLOCK, HOUSE)
 A house also has a unique LINEAR address 
                LA = 0,1,2,..,N-1, N,N+1,......

                            PROBLEM:
 Given a linear address LA, e.g. 1234, determine its BLOCK address, and vice 
 versa. The solution is called the Mailman's algorithm.
 
 IF EVERYTHING COUNTS FROM 0,the algorithm is very simple:

                    BA = (LA / N, LA % N)
                    LA = N*BLOCK + HOUSE

 It is so simple that you may ask: What's all the fuss about?
 QUESTION: WHAT IF they do not count from 0?
============================================================================
             
              Applications of Mailman's Algorithm:

1. Test, Set, Clear BITs in C:
   Consider   char buf[1024]; 
   buf[] has 1024 bytes, known as buf[i], i=0,1,2,...,1023. 
   It also has 8192 BITs numbered 0,1,2,....,8191

   Given a bit number BIT, e.g. 1234, which byte i contains the bit, and which 
   bit j is it in that byte?
   Solution:
               i = BIT / 8      # 8 is because each byte has 8 bits
               j = BIT % 8

   To TST a bit at BIT:  if ( buf[i] & (1 << j) )

   To SET a bit at BIT:  buf[i] |=  (1 << j);
     
   To CLR a bit at BIT:  buf[i] &= ~(1 << j);
 
2. Convert i_number to inode:

   In an EXT2 FS, inodes begin in the inode_table block (e.g. block 5 for FD).
   Each inode has a unique i_number = 1,2,.....

   Given an i_number, e.g. 1234, determine which disk block# contains that
   inode, and which inode# is it in that block?

   We need to know the block# because READ/WRITE real disk is always in block,
   can't just read/write an item inside a disk block.    

   Solution:  block# = (i_number - 1) / INODES_PER_BLOCK + inode_table;
              inode# = (i_number - 1) % INODES_PER_BLOCK;

   TRY TO ANSWER FOR YOURSELF: WHY i_number-1? and WHY + inode_table
   
3. Convert disk block# to CHS = (cyl, head, sector) of a REAL disk:
   A FD has 80 cylinders, each cylinder has 2 tracks (heads), each track has
   18 sectors. A hard disk just has many MORE cylinders, heads and sectors.
 
   Given a (linear) block#, e.g. 1234, determine its (cyl, head, sector) on
   the disk. Some disk drivers takes only (cyl,head,sector) for disk I/O.

   4. Many other LINEAR < - > BLOCK conversion problems.
