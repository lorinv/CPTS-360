                  HOMEWORK Assignment #3
                 DUE: Monday, Feb 2,2015 
                    

1. GIVEN:

#define N 100

typedef struct node{
  struct node *next;
  char name[64];
  int  id;
  int priority;
}NODE;

NODE node[N], *freeList, *readyQueue;

2. Write C code for
   
int init()
{
  (1). each node[i]'s name=nodei; id = i; priority = 0;
  (2). all N nodes are in the freeList;    
  (3). readyQueue = 0;
}

3. Write C functions

int enqueue(NODE **queue, NODE *p) function, 
    which enters the node pointed by p into queue BY PROIRITY;
    by FIFO order if same priority;

PROC *dequeue(NODE **queue) function,
    which removes the node witht the HIGHEST priority and returns its pointer;

int printQueue(NODE *queue) function,
    which prints the node contents of queue;

int changePriority(NODE **queue, char *name, int priority) function,
    which changes the priority of a node with name in queue AND reorder the
    queue if necessary;

4. main()
{
  while(1){
    ask for a command = add |delete |chPriority 

    add: get a free node; 
         node's priority = rand() % 7; 
         enter node into readyQueue;
         print readyQueue BEFORE and AFTER add;
 
   delete: NODE *p = dequene(&readyQueue);
           enter p into freeList;
           print readyQueue BEFORE and AFTER delete;

   chPriority NAME: newPriority = rand() % 7;
                    call YOUR changePriority() to change the priority of
                    the node with NAME to newPriority;
                    as usual, print readyQueue both BEFORE and AFTER;
   }
}
