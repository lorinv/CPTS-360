================= PART 1: CGI PROGRAMMING: ==============================

   Each of you has a user account on the Linux machine cs360.eecs.wsu.edu
        login name = YOUR last name (lower case only)
        password   = YOUR WSU ID number

2. Access YOUR website by

        http://cs360.eecs.wsu.edu/~YOURNAME
       
        ------------------------------------
        |    Welcome to YOUR Website       |
        |       ------------------         |
        |       | YOUR PICTURE   |         |
        |       ------------------         |
        | Input command  :  BOX            | 
        | Input filename1:  BOX            |
        | Input filename2:  BOX            | 
        | Submit command :  Submit BOX     |
        ------------------------------------

3. You will NOT like your current picture. 
   REQUIRED WORK: login to your account by
                  ssh YOURNAME@cs360.eecs.wsu.edu
                  Change it to YOUR pretty picture.

4. When you click the Submit BOX, it submits the strings you entered to the
   httpd (Apache) server on the cs360.eecs.wsu.edu machine, directing it to 
   execute
             ~kcw/cgi-bin/mycgi 
 
  which echos YOUR inputs and shows another input-submit window again.

5. login to your account. As of now, YOUR home directory contains:
 
        public_html --- index.html 
               |
            cgi-bin ---- mycgi.c util.o

5-1. Modify YOUR public_html/index.html file: CHANGE the line

< FORM METHOD="POST" ACTION="http://cs360.eecs.wsu.edu/~kcw/cgi-bin/mycgi" >  TO

< FORM METHOD="POST" ACTION="http://cs360.eecs.wsu.edu/~YOURNAME/cgi-bin/mycgi" >

5-2. Go to YOUR cgi-bin/ directory. Change the line in mycgi.c file

 printf("&lt;FORM METHOD=\"POST\" ACTION=\"http://cs360.eecs.wsu.edu/~kcw/cgi-bin/mycgi\">"); TO

 printf("&lt;FORM METHOD=\"POST\" ACTION=\"http://cs360.eecs.wsu.edu/~YOURNAME/cgi-bin/mycgi\">");

Then run   cc -o mycgi mycgi.c util.o   # generate YOUR OWN mycgi executable.
           chmod u+s mycgi              # chmod mycgi to a SETUID executable

6. Access YOUR webpage again. Enter command and filenames. Then, Submit.
   It should execute YOUR mycgi program in YOUR cgi-bin/ directory.

======================= THEN, DO THESE: ========================================
7. MODIFY mycgi.c to do the following commands:

     mkdir dirname
     rmdir dirname
     rm    filename

     cat   filename
     cp    file1 file2
     ls    [directory] <== if no directory, ls CWD

NOTE: YOUR mycgi program is executed by an Apache process (uid=80). In order for
      the Apache process to write to YOUR directories, you MUST change YOUR 
      mycgi to a setuid program by
            chmod u+s mycgi
When a process executes a setuid program, it temporarily assumes the uid of the
program owner, allowing it to write to the owner's directories.

=================== HELPS =========================
cat, cp : Class Notes #9
ls      : Class Notes #8



========================== PART 2  ====================================

1. Download the server.c and client.c files from ~samples/LAB3.
   cc and run the programs. Modify the programs to do the following:

          client: sends 2 numbers to server, 
          server: returns the SUM of the 2 numbers.
