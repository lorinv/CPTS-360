<H1>CS360 Lab Assignment #2 : sh Simulator</H1>
<pre>

                DUE & DEMO: Monday 2-16-2015

A. OBJECTIVE:
   Understand how Unix sh works by using fork/exec/wait/pipe.
   String operations

B. REQUIREMENTS:
   Write a C program, mysh, which simulates the Unix sh for command processing.
   Your mysh should run as follows:

------------- PART 1: Single Command with I/O Redirection ---------------

1. Prompt for an input line, which is of the form
          cmd arg1 arg2 arg3 .... argn 
   where cmd is a command.

   For simplicity, do NOT consider sh scripts files.
   Valid commands include only "cd", "exit", and ANY Unix binary executables, 
   e.g. echo, ls, date, pwd, cat, cp, mv, cc ... you name it !!!


2. Handle simple commands:
     cmd = "cd"   :  chdir(arg1) OR chdir($HOME) if no arg1;
     cmd = "exit" :  exit(1) to terminate;  

   NOTE: chdir(pathname) is a syscall to change CWD.
         $HOME is the home directory; YOU must find its value from *env[ ].

3. For all other commands:
      fork a child process;
      wait for the child to terminate;
      print child's exit status code
      continue step 1;

4. Child process: First, assume NO pipe in command line:
   4-1. Handle I/O redirection:
          cmd  arg1 arg2 ...  <  infile    // take inputs from infile
          cmd  arg1 arg2 ...  >  outfile   // send outputs to outfile
          cmd  arg1 arg2 ...  >> outfile   // APPEND outputs to outfile
        For simplicity, you may assume at most ONE I/O redirection per line.

   4-2. Execute cmd by execve(), passing parameters 
                char *myargv[], char *env[]
        to the cmd file, 
        where myargv[0]->cmd, myargv[1]->arg1, ....., ending with NULL pointer

   4-2. NOTE: your argv[] must be passed correctly, as in
             cmd one two three
        Then in the cmd program, argc=4, argv[0]="cmd", argv[1]="one", etc.


------------------ PART 2: Commands with Pipes ---------------------------

5. After YOUR mysh works for simple commands, extend it to handle PIPE.
   If the command line has a | symbol:
          divide it into head and tail: e.g.

          cmd1 < infile | cmd 2 > outfile
   
   head = "cmd < infile";   tail = "cmd 2 > outfile"

   Then consult the pipe example code in the class notes to see HOW TO 
        create a pipe
        fork a child process to share the pipe
        arrange one process as the pipe writer, and
          the other process as the pipe reader.
        Then, let each process execve() to its command
              (possibly with I/O redirection).
 

6. ===================== BONUS ====================
   If YOUR mysh can handle MULTIPLE pipes like

           cat file | grep "test" | more
           cat fle  | cat | grep "test" | more
   etc.
   ===============================================


7. SAMPLE SOLUTION:
   
   ~samples/LAB2/lab2.bin          (down load and run under Linux)
           OR 
   ~samples/LAB2/lab2.static.bin   (statically linked binay executable)
